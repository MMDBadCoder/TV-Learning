1
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.124
Smeagol!

2
00:01:19.293 --> 00:01:21.535
I've got one!

3
00:01:22.171 --> 00:01:24.164
I've got a fish, Smeag. Smeagol!

4
00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.459
Pull it in. Go on. Go on. Go on. Pull it in.

5
00:01:35.684 --> 00:01:37.511
Deagol!

6
00:02:34.908 --> 00:02:36.735
Deagol?

7
00:02:39.288 --> 00:02:41.529
Deagol.

8
00:02:57.347 --> 00:02:59.423
Give us that, Deagol, my love.

9
00:03:04.395 --> 00:03:05.676
Why?

10
00:03:06.772 --> 00:03:09.014
Because...

11
00:03:09.191 --> 00:03:12.940
it's my birthday and I wants it.

12
00:04:46.995 --> 00:04:52.238
My precious.

13
00:04:59.799 --> 00:05:02.716
They cursed us.

14
00:05:02.885 --> 00:05:04.260
Murderer.

15
00:05:04.429 --> 00:05:06.884
"Murderer" they called us.

16
00:05:07.056 --> 00:05:11.847
They cursed us and drove us away.

17
00:05:12.978 --> 00:05:14.686
Gollum.

18
00:05:14.854 --> 00:05:16.563
Gollum.

19
00:05:16.732 --> 00:05:18.688
Gollum.

20
00:05:22.237 --> 00:05:25.238
And we wept, precious.

21
00:05:25.406 --> 00:05:28.989
We wept to be so alone.

22
00:05:31.579 --> 00:05:35.363
- and cool
- So nice for feet

23
00:05:36.376 --> 00:05:40.753
And we only wish To catch a fish

24
00:05:40.922 --> 00:05:44.172
So juicy sweet

25
00:05:49.931 --> 00:05:54.058
And we forgot the taste of bread...

26
00:05:54.226 --> 00:05:57.844
the sound of trees...

27
00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:01.934
the softness of the wind.

28
00:06:02.567 --> 00:06:08.238
We even forgot our own name.

29
00:06:16.373 --> 00:06:22.790
My precious.

30
00:07:07.047 --> 00:07:09.288
Wake up!

31
00:07:10.342 --> 00:07:12.002
Wake up!

32
00:07:12.177 --> 00:07:13.969
Wake up, sleepies.

33
00:07:14.137 --> 00:07:16.010
We must go, yes.

34
00:07:16.181 --> 00:07:18.850
We must go at once.

35
00:07:22.395 --> 00:07:25.479
Haven't you had any sleep, Mr. Frodo?

36
00:07:27.692 --> 00:07:30.230
I've gone and had too much.

37
00:07:31.612 --> 00:07:33.355
Must be getting late.

38
00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:35.025
No.

39
00:07:35.199 --> 00:07:37.108
It isn't.

40
00:07:37.284 --> 00:07:40.320
It isn't midday yet.

41
00:07:40.496 --> 00:07:43.069
The days are growing darker.

42
00:07:47.336 --> 00:07:49.543
Come on!

43
00:07:51.966 --> 00:07:54.207
Must go! No time!

44
00:07:54.384 --> 00:07:56.756
Not before Mr. Frodo's had something to eat.

45
00:07:56.928 --> 00:07:59.799
No time to lose, silly.

46
00:08:08.565 --> 00:08:09.845
Here.

47
00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:14.896
What about you?

48
00:08:15.071 --> 00:08:18.440
Oh, no, I'm not hungry.
Leastways, not for lembas bread.

49
00:08:19.034 --> 00:08:20.408
Sam.

50
00:08:22.996 --> 00:08:24.538
All right.

51
00:08:24.705 --> 00:08:27.196
We don't have that much left.

52
00:08:27.375 --> 00:08:30.245
We have to be careful or we're going to run out.

53
00:08:32.421 --> 00:08:35.339
You go ahead and eat that, Mr. Frodo.

54
00:08:35.507 --> 00:08:36.918
I've rationed it.

55
00:08:37.426 --> 00:08:39.086
There should be enough.

56
00:08:41.263 --> 00:08:42.461
For what?

57
00:08:44.141 --> 00:08:45.884
The journey home.

58
00:08:53.733 --> 00:08:56.058
Come, Hobbitses.

59
00:08:57.445 --> 00:08:59.319
Very close now.

60
00:08:59.489 --> 00:09:02.739
Very close to Mordor.

61
00:09:02.909 --> 00:09:05.578
No safe places here.

62
00:09:05.745 --> 00:09:07.903
Hurry.

63
00:10:00.298 --> 00:10:02.006
It's good.

64
00:10:02.926 --> 00:10:04.669
Definitely from the Shire.

65
00:10:06.888 --> 00:10:09.011
Longbottom Leaf.

66
00:10:14.354 --> 00:10:18.683
I feel like I'm back at The Green Dragon.

67
00:10:19.775 --> 00:10:23.025
- Green Dragon.
- A mug of ale in my hand.

68
00:10:23.195 --> 00:10:27.774
Putting my feet up on a settle after a hard day's work.

69
00:10:28.367 --> 00:10:31.818
Only, you've never done a hard day's work.

70
00:10:44.633 --> 00:10:47.669
Welcome, my lords...

71
00:10:47.844 --> 00:10:50.086
to Isengard!

72
00:10:50.472 --> 00:10:54.220
You young rascals! A merry hunt you've led us on...

73
00:10:54.392 --> 00:10:59.386
and now we find you feasting and... and smoking!

74
00:10:59.564 --> 00:11:02.731
We are sitting on a field of victory...

75
00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:06.400
enjoying a few well-earned comforts.

76
00:11:07.488 --> 00:11:11.320
The salted pork is particularly good.

77
00:11:11.868 --> 00:11:14.240
Salted pork?

78
00:11:15.454 --> 00:11:18.870
- Hobbits.
- We're under orders from Treebeard...

79
00:11:19.041 --> 00:11:21.876
who's taken over management of Isengard.

80
00:11:24.421 --> 00:11:27.422
Young Master Gandalf.

81
00:11:27.591 --> 00:11:32.170
I'm glad you've come.

82
00:11:32.346 --> 00:11:36.758
Wood and water, stock and stone I can master.

83
00:11:36.933 --> 00:11:40.599
But there is a wizard to manage here...

84
00:11:40.770 --> 00:11:42.763
locked in his tower.

85
00:11:45.441 --> 00:11:46.770
Show yourself.

86
00:11:47.026 --> 00:11:48.734
Be careful.

87
00:11:49.528 --> 00:11:52.198
Even in defeat, Saruman is dangerous.

88
00:11:52.365 --> 00:11:54.488
Well, let's just have his head and be done with it.

89
00:11:54.659 --> 00:11:56.698
No.

90
00:11:57.036 --> 00:11:59.361
We need him alive.

91
00:12:00.373 --> 00:12:02.946
We need him to talk.

92
00:12:04.836 --> 00:12:09.046
You have fought many wars and
slain many men, Theoden King...

93
00:12:09.214 --> 00:12:10.708
and made peace afterwards.

94
00:12:10.883 --> 00:12:15.841
Can we not take counsel together
as we once did, my old friend?

95
00:12:16.012 --> 00:12:19.216
Can we not have peace, you and I?

96
00:12:19.391 --> 00:12:21.300
We shall have peace.

97
00:12:23.228 --> 00:12:25.351
We shall have peace...

98
00:12:25.522 --> 00:12:29.566
when you answer for the burning of the Westfold...

99
00:12:29.735 --> 00:12:32.486
and the children that lie dead there!

100
00:12:33.238 --> 00:12:37.402
We shall have peace when the lives of the soldiers...

101
00:12:37.575 --> 00:12:39.652
whose bodies were hewn even as they lay dead...

102
00:12:39.828 --> 00:12:43.363
against the gates of the Hornburg, are avenged!

103
00:12:44.916 --> 00:12:50.503
When you hang from a gibbet for
the sport of your own crows...

104
00:12:51.422 --> 00:12:53.664
we shall have peace.

105
00:12:56.427 --> 00:12:59.131
Gibbets and crows?

106
00:12:59.472 --> 00:13:00.716
Dotard!

107
00:13:02.182 --> 00:13:05.017
What do you want, Gandalf Greyhame?

108
00:13:06.019 --> 00:13:08.511
Let me guess. The Key of Orthanc.

109
00:13:08.689 --> 00:13:11.606
Or perhaps the Keys of Barad-dur itself...

110
00:13:11.775 --> 00:13:15.772
along with the crowns of the seven
kings and the rods of the Five Wizards!

111
00:13:15.946 --> 00:13:18.899
Your treachery has already cost many lives.

112
00:13:19.074 --> 00:13:21.446
Thousands more are now at risk.

113
00:13:21.618 --> 00:13:23.990
But you could save them, Saruman.

114
00:13:24.162 --> 00:13:26.450
You were deep in the enemy's counsel.

115
00:13:26.623 --> 00:13:29.908
So you have come here for information.

116
00:13:30.793 --> 00:13:32.621
I have some for you.

117
00:13:38.092 --> 00:13:41.046
Something festers in the heart of Middle-earth.

118
00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:43.462
Something that you have failed to see.

119
00:13:45.975 --> 00:13:49.474
But the Great Eye has seen it.

120
00:13:50.521 --> 00:13:54.221
Even now he presses his advantage.

121
00:13:55.984 --> 00:13:59.318
His attack will come soon.

122
00:14:01.532 --> 00:14:03.655
You're all going to die.

123
00:14:06.161 --> 00:14:09.411
But you know this, don't you, Gandalf?

124
00:14:09.581 --> 00:14:14.207
You cannot think that this Ranger will
ever sit upon the throne of Gondor.

125
00:14:14.378 --> 00:14:20.463
This exile, crept from the
shadows, will never be crowned king.

126
00:14:21.802 --> 00:14:25.466
Gandalf does not hesitate to
sacrifice those closest to him...

127
00:14:26.389 --> 00:14:28.595
those he professes to love.

128
00:14:29.642 --> 00:14:34.185
Tell me, what words of comfort
did you give the Halfling...

129
00:14:34.355 --> 00:14:37.391
before you sent him to his doom?

130
00:14:39.818 --> 00:14:44.528
The path that you have set
him on can only lead to death.

131
00:14:44.865 --> 00:14:47.024
I've heard enough!

132
00:14:47.201 --> 00:14:49.027
Shoot him. Stick an arrow in his gob.

133
00:14:49.536 --> 00:14:51.196
No.

134
00:14:51.664 --> 00:14:53.870
Come down, Saruman...

135
00:14:54.041 --> 00:14:57.990
- and your life will be spared.
- Save your pity and your mercy.

136
00:14:58.170 --> 00:14:59.498
I have no use for it!

137
00:15:08.721 --> 00:15:10.180
Saruman...

138
00:15:11.224 --> 00:15:14.391
your staff is broken.

139
00:15:25.279 --> 00:15:28.731
Grima, you need not follow him.

140
00:15:29.908 --> 00:15:32.578
You were not always as you are now.

141
00:15:32.745 --> 00:15:35.580
You were once a Man of Rohan.

142
00:15:35.748 --> 00:15:36.993
Come down.

143
00:15:37.166 --> 00:15:39.871
A Man of Rohan?

144
00:15:40.795 --> 00:15:43.036
What is the house of Rohan...

145
00:15:43.213 --> 00:15:46.879
but a thatched barn where brigands drink in the reek...

146
00:15:47.050 --> 00:15:50.751
and their brats roll on the floor with the dogs?

147
00:15:51.263 --> 00:15:57.716
The victory at Helm's Deep does not
belong to you, Theoden Horse-master.

148
00:15:58.353 --> 00:16:02.931
You are a lesser son of greater sires.

149
00:16:05.276 --> 00:16:06.984
Grima...

150
00:16:07.821 --> 00:16:09.694
come down.

151
00:16:10.031 --> 00:16:11.442
Be free of him.

152
00:16:11.617 --> 00:16:15.614
- Free? He will never be free.
- No.

153
00:16:15.995 --> 00:16:18.617
Get down, cur!

154
00:16:20.374 --> 00:16:21.655
Saruman!

155
00:16:21.834 --> 00:16:24.455
You were deep in the enemy's counsel.

156
00:16:24.962 --> 00:16:27.121
Tell us what you know!

157
00:16:28.633 --> 00:16:33.875
You withdraw your guard, and I will
tell you where your doom will be decided.

158
00:16:34.054 --> 00:16:37.589
I will not be held prisoner here.

159
00:17:04.709 --> 00:17:06.252
Send word to all our allies...

160
00:17:06.419 --> 00:17:09.337
and to every corner of
Middle-earth that still stands free.

161
00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:13.001
The enemy moves against us. We
need to know where he will strike.

162
00:17:32.194 --> 00:17:36.144
The filth of Saruman...

163
00:17:36.323 --> 00:17:40.154
is washing away.

164
00:17:40.327 --> 00:17:44.870
Trees will come back to live here.

165
00:17:45.373 --> 00:17:47.532
Young trees.

166
00:17:47.709 --> 00:17:49.915
- Wild trees.
- Pippin!

167
00:17:59.387 --> 00:18:01.546
Bless my bark!

168
00:18:01.723 --> 00:18:03.596
Peregrin Took!

169
00:18:03.767 --> 00:18:06.388
I'll take that, my lad.

170
00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:08.435
Quickly, now.

171
00:18:58.611 --> 00:19:04.197
Tonight we remember those who gave
their blood to defend this country.

172
00:19:04.867 --> 00:19:06.907
Hail the victorious dead.

173
00:19:07.077 --> 00:19:08.488
Hail!

174
00:19:19.465 --> 00:19:21.374
No pauses.

175
00:19:21.550 --> 00:19:25.714
- No spills.
- And no regurgitation.

176
00:19:26.221 --> 00:19:27.881
So it's a drinking game?

177
00:19:29.433 --> 00:19:32.137
Last one standing wins.

178
00:19:36.481 --> 00:19:38.474
What'll we drink to? Let's drink to victory!

179
00:19:38.650 --> 00:19:40.061
To victory!

180
00:20:24.027 --> 00:20:25.687
I am happy for you.

181
00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:28.479
He is an honorable man.

182
00:20:28.907 --> 00:20:31.362
You are both honorable men.

183
00:20:33.203 --> 00:20:38.541
It was not Theoden of Rohan
who led our people to victory.

184
00:20:46.716 --> 00:20:48.542
Don't listen to me.

185
00:20:49.385 --> 00:20:50.879
You are young.

186
00:20:51.053 --> 00:20:53.379
And tonight is for you.

187
00:21:07.736 --> 00:21:09.396
Here, here.

188
00:21:10.906 --> 00:21:16.825
It's the Dwarves that go
swimming with little, hairy women.

189
00:21:22.209 --> 00:21:23.453
I feel something.

190
00:21:25.587 --> 00:21:28.077
A slight tingle in my fingers.

191
00:21:28.798 --> 00:21:30.375
I think it's affecting me.

192
00:21:32.302 --> 00:21:34.009
What did I say?

193
00:21:34.178 --> 00:21:37.512
He can't hold his liquor.

194
00:21:44.855 --> 00:21:46.184
Game over.

195
00:21:46.356 --> 00:21:49.773
Oh, you can search far and wide
You can drink the whole town dry

196
00:21:49.943 --> 00:21:53.893
But you'll never find a beer so brown
But you'll never find a beer so brown

197
00:21:54.073 --> 00:21:58.449
As the one we drink in our hometown
As the one we drink in our hometown

198
00:21:58.619 --> 00:22:02.533
You can drink your fancy ales
You can drink them by the flagon

199
00:22:02.706 --> 00:22:05.872
But the only brew for the brave and true

200
00:22:08.504 --> 00:22:09.783
Pippin!

201
00:22:10.255 --> 00:22:13.291
But the only brew for the brave and true

202
00:22:13.633 --> 00:22:16.338
Comes from The Green Dragon

203
00:22:19.056 --> 00:22:21.890
Thank you! I win!

204
00:22:23.643 --> 00:22:26.134
No news of Frodo?

205
00:22:26.312 --> 00:22:29.812
No word. Nothing.

206
00:22:30.650 --> 00:22:32.808
We have time.

207
00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:37.605
Every day, Frodo moves closer to Mordor.

208
00:22:38.365 --> 00:22:40.442
Do we know that?

209
00:22:44.288 --> 00:22:45.996
What does your heart tell you?

210
00:22:53.047 --> 00:22:56.380
That Frodo is alive.

211
00:22:58.552 --> 00:23:00.343
Yes.

212
00:23:02.931 --> 00:23:05.089
Yes, he's alive.

213
00:23:07.352 --> 00:23:10.187
Too risky. Too risky.

214
00:23:10.355 --> 00:23:11.600
Thieves.

215
00:23:11.773 --> 00:23:13.812
They stole it from us.

216
00:23:13.983 --> 00:23:17.483
Kill them. Kill them. Kill them both.

217
00:23:19.530 --> 00:23:22.365
Quiet! Mustn't wake them.

218
00:23:22.533 --> 00:23:25.071
Mustn't ruin it now.

219
00:23:25.244 --> 00:23:27.321
But they knows.

220
00:23:27.497 --> 00:23:29.370
They knows.

221
00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:32.161
They suspects us.

222
00:23:33.377 --> 00:23:36.911
What's it saying, my precious, my love?

223
00:23:37.089 --> 00:23:40.671
Is Smeagol losing his nerve?

224
00:23:41.343 --> 00:23:43.715
No. Not.

225
00:23:43.888 --> 00:23:48.134
Never. Smeagol hates nasty Hobbitses.

226
00:23:48.308 --> 00:23:53.136
Smeagol wants to see them dead.

227
00:23:53.313 --> 00:23:55.851
And we will.

228
00:23:56.024 --> 00:24:00.069
Smeagol did it once. He can do it again.

229
00:24:03.406 --> 00:24:06.076
It's ours!

230
00:24:06.242 --> 00:24:08.912
Ours!

231
00:24:10.038 --> 00:24:12.908
We must get the precious. We must get it back.

232
00:24:13.082 --> 00:24:16.498
Patience! Patience, my love.

233
00:24:16.669 --> 00:24:21.047
First we must lead them to her.

234
00:24:21.924 --> 00:24:26.918
We lead them to the Winding Stair.

235
00:24:27.096 --> 00:24:29.765
Yes, the stairs. And then?

236
00:24:29.932 --> 00:24:32.932
Up, up, up, up, up the stairs we go...

237
00:24:33.102 --> 00:24:39.519
until we come to the tunnel.

238
00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:43.020
And when they go in...

239
00:24:43.195 --> 00:24:45.982
there's no coming out.

240
00:24:46.907 --> 00:24:49.778
She's always hungry.

241
00:24:50.536 --> 00:24:54.746
She always needs to feed.

242
00:24:54.914 --> 00:24:56.325
She must eat.

243
00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:58.622
All she gets is filthy Orcses.

244
00:24:58.794 --> 00:25:01.545
And they doesn't taste very nice, does they, precious?

245
00:25:02.172 --> 00:25:03.796
No.

246
00:25:03.965 --> 00:25:08.674
Not very nice at all, my love.

247
00:25:08.845 --> 00:25:11.632
She hungers for sweeter meats.

248
00:25:11.806 --> 00:25:13.633
Hobbit meat.

249
00:25:13.807 --> 00:25:18.636
And when she throws away the
bones and the empty clothes...

250
00:25:18.813 --> 00:25:21.897
then we will find it.

251
00:25:22.066 --> 00:25:26.394
And take it for me!

252
00:25:28.155 --> 00:25:29.566
For us.

253
00:25:30.074 --> 00:25:33.075
Yes. We meant "for us."

254
00:25:33.243 --> 00:25:36.695
Gollum. Gollum.

255
00:25:36.872 --> 00:25:41.368
The precious will be ours...

256
00:25:41.542 --> 00:25:46.039
once the Hobbitses are dead!

257
00:25:46.548 --> 00:25:48.007
You treacherous little toad!

258
00:25:50.718 --> 00:25:53.007
No! No! Master!

259
00:25:53.179 --> 00:25:54.804
No, Sam! Leave him alone!

260
00:25:55.682 --> 00:25:58.351
I heard it from his own mouth. He means to murder us.

261
00:25:58.517 --> 00:26:02.681
Never! Smeagol wouldn't hurt a fly.

262
00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:06.763
He's a horrid, fat Hobbit...

263
00:26:06.943 --> 00:26:08.521
who hates Smeagol...

264
00:26:08.694 --> 00:26:11.482
and who makes up nasty lies.

265
00:26:11.656 --> 00:26:14.324
You miserable little maggot! I'll stove your head in!

266
00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:15.980
Sam!

267
00:26:16.368 --> 00:26:18.657
Call me a liar? You're a liar!

268
00:26:19.621 --> 00:26:23.535
- You scare him off, we're lost!
- I don't care! I can't do it, Mr. Frodo.

269
00:26:23.709 --> 00:26:26.876
- I won't wait around for him to kill us!
- I'm not sending him away.

270
00:26:27.212 --> 00:26:28.541
You don't see it, do you?

271
00:26:28.964 --> 00:26:30.374
He's a villain.

272
00:26:31.383 --> 00:26:35.001
We can't do this by ourselves,
Sam. Not without a guide.

273
00:26:35.846 --> 00:26:38.716
I need you on my side.

274
00:26:39.516 --> 00:26:41.841
I'm on your side, Mr. Frodo.

275
00:26:43.353 --> 00:26:46.307
I know, Sam. I know.

276
00:26:46.856 --> 00:26:48.849
Trust me.

277
00:26:49.025 --> 00:26:51.397
Come, Smeagol.

278
00:27:59.343 --> 00:28:00.802
What time is it?

279
00:28:03.139 --> 00:28:04.633
Not yet dawn.

280
00:28:11.563 --> 00:28:14.599
I dreamed I saw a great wave...

281
00:28:14.774 --> 00:28:18.773
climbing over green lands and above the hills.

282
00:28:20.030 --> 00:28:22.485
I stood upon the brink.

283
00:28:23.408 --> 00:28:26.575
It was utterly dark in the abyss before my feet.

284
00:28:28.496 --> 00:28:31.283
A light shone behind me...

285
00:28:31.916 --> 00:28:34.324
but I could not turn.

286
00:28:34.502 --> 00:28:37.918
I could only stand there, waiting.

287
00:28:39.382 --> 00:28:42.086
Night changes many thoughts.

288
00:28:42.468 --> 00:28:44.627
Sleep, Eowyn.

289
00:28:45.179 --> 00:28:47.421
Sleep...

290
00:28:50.142 --> 00:28:52.016
while you can.

291
00:29:16.167 --> 00:29:18.456
The stars are veiled.

292
00:29:19.463 --> 00:29:22.961
Something stirs in the east.

293
00:29:23.633 --> 00:29:26.752
A sleepless malice.

294
00:29:28.763 --> 00:29:31.550
The Eye of the enemy is moving.

295
00:29:44.987 --> 00:29:47.692
What are you doing?

296
00:29:52.327 --> 00:29:53.786
Pippin!

297
00:30:01.295 --> 00:30:03.038
Pippin?

298
00:30:15.933 --> 00:30:17.262
Pippin.

299
00:30:17.936 --> 00:30:20.605
- What, are you mad?
- I just want to look at it.

300
00:30:20.772 --> 00:30:21.886
Just one more time.

301
00:30:22.148 --> 00:30:24.224
Put it back.

302
00:30:34.494 --> 00:30:36.285
Pippin.

303
00:30:42.793 --> 00:30:44.288
No!

304
00:30:49.382 --> 00:30:50.628
Pippin.

305
00:30:53.971 --> 00:30:55.169
He is here.

306
00:30:55.347 --> 00:30:57.635
I see you.

307
00:31:00.643 --> 00:31:02.268
Pippin!

308
00:31:16.910 --> 00:31:19.661
Help! Gandalf, help!

309
00:31:21.414 --> 00:31:23.287
Someone help him!

310
00:31:29.672 --> 00:31:30.870
Pippin!

311
00:31:32.008 --> 00:31:33.252
Fool of a Took!

312
00:31:54.362 --> 00:31:56.569
Look at me.

313
00:31:58.533 --> 00:32:02.661
Gandalf, forgive me.

314
00:32:02.829 --> 00:32:04.703
Look at me.

315
00:32:04.872 --> 00:32:06.700
What did you see?

316
00:32:10.211 --> 00:32:12.287
A tree.

317
00:32:13.256 --> 00:32:15.130
There was a white tree...

318
00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:16.794
in a courtyard of stone.

319
00:32:19.596 --> 00:32:20.875
It was dead.

320
00:32:25.059 --> 00:32:26.885
The city was burning.

321
00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:30.430
Minas Tirith? Is that what you saw?

322
00:32:31.107 --> 00:32:33.145
I saw...

323
00:32:36.528 --> 00:32:37.904
I saw him.

324
00:32:40.908 --> 00:32:43.150
I could hear his voice in my head.

325
00:32:43.327 --> 00:32:45.734
And what did you tell him?

326
00:32:45.912 --> 00:32:47.739
Speak!

327
00:32:51.918 --> 00:32:55.084
He asked me my name. I didn't answer.

328
00:32:55.255 --> 00:32:56.714
He hurt me.

329
00:32:56.882 --> 00:32:59.337
What did you tell him about Frodo and the Ring?

330
00:33:02.846 --> 00:33:05.301
There was no lie in Pippin's eyes.

331
00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:08.382
A fool...

332
00:33:08.559 --> 00:33:10.848
but an honest fool he remains.

333
00:33:11.312 --> 00:33:14.847
He told Sauron nothing of Frodo and the Ring.

334
00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:18.272
We've been strangely fortunate.

335
00:33:18.444 --> 00:33:22.311
Pippin saw in the palantir a
glimpse of the enemy's plan.

336
00:33:23.241 --> 00:33:27.190
Sauron moves to strike the city of Minas Tirith.

337
00:33:27.787 --> 00:33:31.535
His defeat at Helm's Deep showed our enemy one thing.

338
00:33:31.707 --> 00:33:34.032
He knows the heir of Elendil has come forth.

339
00:33:34.209 --> 00:33:36.332
Men are not as weak as he supposed.

340
00:33:36.503 --> 00:33:40.287
There is courage still, strength
enough perhaps to challenge him.

341
00:33:40.507 --> 00:33:42.381
Sauron fears this.

342
00:33:42.550 --> 00:33:46.880
He will not risk the peoples of
Middle-earth uniting under one banner.

343
00:33:48.056 --> 00:33:50.464
He will raze Minas Tirith to the ground...

344
00:33:50.642 --> 00:33:54.141
before he sees a king return to the throne of Men.

345
00:33:54.312 --> 00:33:58.226
If the beacons of Gondor are
lit, Rohan must be ready for war.

346
00:33:59.150 --> 00:34:01.356
Tell me...

347
00:34:01.527 --> 00:34:05.311
why should we ride to the aid of
those who did not come to ours?

348
00:34:09.201 --> 00:34:11.028
What do we owe Gondor?

349
00:34:12.162 --> 00:34:14.202
- I will go.
- No!

350
00:34:14.373 --> 00:34:17.539
- They must be warned.
- They will be.

351
00:34:20.963 --> 00:34:23.501
You must come to Minas Tirith by another road.

352
00:34:24.049 --> 00:34:28.510
Follow the river. Look to the black ships.

353
00:34:29.471 --> 00:34:31.429
Understand this:

354
00:34:31.598 --> 00:34:35.263
Things are now in motion that cannot be undone.

355
00:34:36.770 --> 00:34:38.845
I ride for Minas Tirith...

356
00:34:41.107 --> 00:34:43.777
and I won't be going alone.

357
00:34:45.528 --> 00:34:49.193
Of all the inquisitive Hobbits,
Peregrin Took, you are the worst.

358
00:34:50.199 --> 00:34:51.860
Hurry! Hurry!

359
00:34:53.370 --> 00:34:54.779
Where are we going?

360
00:34:54.954 --> 00:34:56.199
Why did you look?

361
00:34:56.373 --> 00:34:59.123
Why do you always have to look?

362
00:34:59.291 --> 00:35:02.375
- I don't know. I can't help it.
- You never can.

363
00:35:02.837 --> 00:35:04.247
I'm sorry, all right?

364
00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:09.258
- I won't do it again.
- Don't you understand?

365
00:35:10.011 --> 00:35:11.967
The enemy thinks you have the Ring.

366
00:35:12.137 --> 00:35:15.885
He's going to be looking for you,
Pip. They have to get you out of here.

367
00:35:17.309 --> 00:35:19.979
And you...? You're coming with me?

368
00:35:22.189 --> 00:35:23.599
Merry?

369
00:35:23.774 --> 00:35:25.054
Come on.

370
00:35:30.572 --> 00:35:31.948
How far is Minas Tirith?

371
00:35:32.115 --> 00:35:34.736
Three days' ride, as the Nazgul flies.

372
00:35:34.909 --> 00:35:38.409
And you better hope we don't
have one of those on our tail.

373
00:35:39.122 --> 00:35:40.616
Here.

374
00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:42.582
Something for the road.

375
00:35:43.460 --> 00:35:45.416
The last of the Longbottom Leaf.

376
00:35:45.587 --> 00:35:49.584
I know you've run out. You smoke too much, Pippin.

377
00:35:49.757 --> 00:35:52.248
But... But we'll see each other soon.

378
00:35:55.596 --> 00:35:58.087
- Won't we?
- I don't know.

379
00:36:00.101 --> 00:36:02.140
I don't know what's going to happen.

380
00:36:02.311 --> 00:36:04.019
- Merry.
- Run, Shadowfax.

381
00:36:04.188 --> 00:36:05.646
Show us the meaning of haste.

382
00:36:05.814 --> 00:36:07.724
Merry!

383
00:36:18.202 --> 00:36:19.316
Merry!

384
00:36:29.796 --> 00:36:31.290
He's always followed me...

385
00:36:31.965 --> 00:36:34.004
everywhere I went...

386
00:36:34.342 --> 00:36:36.133
since before we were tweens.

387
00:36:37.303 --> 00:36:41.217
I would get him into the worst sort of trouble...

388
00:36:41.390 --> 00:36:43.466
but I was always there to get him out.

389
00:36:45.936 --> 00:36:47.811
Now he's gone.

390
00:36:49.482 --> 00:36:52.399
Just like Frodo and Sam.

391
00:36:53.027 --> 00:36:55.778
One thing I have learned about Hobbits:

392
00:36:55.946 --> 00:36:57.607
They're a most hardy folk.

393
00:36:58.156 --> 00:37:01.857
Foolhardy, maybe. He's a Took.

394
00:37:16.341 --> 00:37:18.629
Take her by the safest road.

395
00:37:18.802 --> 00:37:21.293
A ship lies anchored in the Grey Havens.

396
00:37:21.471 --> 00:37:25.338
It waits to carry her across the sea.

397
00:37:25.516 --> 00:37:28.886
The last journey of Arwen Undomiel.

398
00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:37.585
There is nothing for you here...

399
00:38:38.087 --> 00:38:40.293
only death.

400
00:38:47.596 --> 00:38:48.877
Lady Arwen...

401
00:38:49.807 --> 00:38:51.715
we cannot delay.

402
00:38:54.186 --> 00:38:55.430
My lady!

403
00:39:14.831 --> 00:39:17.452
- Tell me what you have seen.
- Arwen.

404
00:39:17.625 --> 00:39:19.582
You have the gift of foresight.

405
00:39:19.752 --> 00:39:21.544
What did you see?

406
00:39:22.171 --> 00:39:25.505
I looked into your future, and I saw death.

407
00:39:26.050 --> 00:39:28.172
But there is also life.

408
00:39:30.096 --> 00:39:34.140
You saw there was a child. You saw my son.

409
00:39:34.767 --> 00:39:37.304
That future is almost gone.

410
00:39:37.478 --> 00:39:39.470
But it is not lost.

411
00:39:42.066 --> 00:39:44.272
Nothing is certain.

412
00:39:45.986 --> 00:39:48.691
Some things are certain.

413
00:39:52.493 --> 00:39:55.327
If I leave him now...

414
00:39:55.495 --> 00:39:58.116
I will regret it forever.

415
00:39:59.207 --> 00:40:01.532
It is time.

416
00:40:06.797 --> 00:40:10.581
From the ashes a fire shall be woken

417
00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:14.176
A light from the shadow shall spring

418
00:40:14.346 --> 00:40:17.632
Renewed shall be blade that was broken

419
00:40:25.023 --> 00:40:28.227
The crownless again shall be king

420
00:40:31.989 --> 00:40:34.028
Re-forge the sword.

421
00:41:08.899 --> 00:41:11.604
Your hands are cold.

422
00:41:14.988 --> 00:41:18.109
The life of the Eldar is leaving you.

423
00:41:21.537 --> 00:41:23.446
This was my choice.

424
00:41:25.290 --> 00:41:27.579
Whether by your will or not...

425
00:41:28.919 --> 00:41:33.213
there is no ship now that can bear me hence.

426
00:42:20.427 --> 00:42:23.263
We've just passed into the realm of Gondor.

427
00:42:34.900 --> 00:42:37.141
Minas Tirith.

428
00:42:37.736 --> 00:42:40.061
City of kings.

429
00:43:11.435 --> 00:43:13.227
Make way!

430
00:43:42.423 --> 00:43:44.251
It's the tree.

431
00:43:44.425 --> 00:43:46.085
Gandalf. Gandalf.

432
00:43:46.260 --> 00:43:48.502
Yes, the White Tree of Gondor.

433
00:43:48.679 --> 00:43:50.506
The tree of the king.

434
00:43:50.681 --> 00:43:53.351
Lord Denethor, however, is not king.

435
00:43:53.518 --> 00:43:56.186
He is a steward only, a caretaker of the throne.

436
00:43:56.937 --> 00:44:00.472
Now listen carefully. Lord
Denethor is Boromir's father.

437
00:44:01.025 --> 00:44:04.809
To give him news of his beloved
son's death would be most unwise.

438
00:44:05.278 --> 00:44:08.730
And do not mention Frodo or the Ring.

439
00:44:09.616 --> 00:44:12.368
And say nothing of Aragorn either.

440
00:44:14.204 --> 00:44:18.071
In fact, it's better if you
don't speak at all, Peregrin Took.

441
00:44:48.238 --> 00:44:54.738
Hail Denethor, son of Ecthelion,
lord and steward of Gondor.

442
00:45:00.249 --> 00:45:04.957
I come with tidings in this
dark hour, and with counsel.

443
00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:09.290
Perhaps you come to explain this.

444
00:45:14.929 --> 00:45:19.472
Perhaps you come to tell me why my son is dead.

445
00:45:33.948 --> 00:45:36.948
Boromir died to save us...

446
00:45:37.118 --> 00:45:38.778
my kinsman and me.

447
00:45:38.953 --> 00:45:42.452
- He fell defending us from many foes.
- Pippin.

448
00:45:47.962 --> 00:45:51.412
I offer you my service, such as it is...

449
00:45:51.965 --> 00:45:53.958
in payment of this debt.

450
00:45:56.136 --> 00:45:59.469
This is my first command to you.

451
00:46:00.182 --> 00:46:03.633
How did you escape and my son did not...

452
00:46:03.976 --> 00:46:06.302
so mighty a man as he was?

453
00:46:06.980 --> 00:46:10.313
The mightiest man may be slain by one arrow...

454
00:46:10.567 --> 00:46:12.476
and Boromir was pierced by many.

455
00:46:16.615 --> 00:46:18.322
Get up.

456
00:46:18.491 --> 00:46:23.117
My lord, there will be a time to grieve for Boromir...

457
00:46:23.579 --> 00:46:25.322
but it is not now.

458
00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:28.246
War is coming.

459
00:46:28.584 --> 00:46:32.996
The enemy is on your doorstep.
As steward, you are charged...

460
00:46:33.172 --> 00:46:37.335
with the defense of this city.
Where are Gondor's armies?

461
00:46:37.509 --> 00:46:42.385
You still have friends. You
are not alone in this fight.

462
00:46:42.556 --> 00:46:47.052
Send word to Theoden of Rohan. Light the beacons.

463
00:46:48.645 --> 00:46:52.180
You think you are wise, Mithrandir.

464
00:46:52.357 --> 00:46:55.394
Yet for all your subtleties, you have not wisdom.

465
00:46:57.529 --> 00:47:01.692
Do you think the eyes of the White Tower are blind?

466
00:47:01.866 --> 00:47:04.951
I have seen more than you know.

467
00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:08.323
With your left hand you would
use me as a shield against Mordor.

468
00:47:08.498 --> 00:47:11.368
And with your right you'd seek to supplant me.

469
00:47:11.542 --> 00:47:15.243
I know who rides with Theoden of Rohan.

470
00:47:15.421 --> 00:47:21.376
Oh, yes. Word has reached my ears
of this Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

471
00:47:21.552 --> 00:47:26.380
And I tell you now, I will not bow
to this Ranger from the North...

472
00:47:26.557 --> 00:47:31.053
last of a ragged house long bereft of lordship.

473
00:47:31.228 --> 00:47:37.064
Authority is not given to you to
deny the return of the king, steward.

474
00:47:37.234 --> 00:47:41.647
The rule of Gondor is mine and no other's.

475
00:47:46.827 --> 00:47:48.618
Come.

476
00:47:56.545 --> 00:47:59.118
All has turned to vain ambition.

477
00:47:59.297 --> 00:48:02.748
He would even use his grief as a cloak.

478
00:48:05.637 --> 00:48:08.423
A thousand years this city has stood.

479
00:48:09.516 --> 00:48:11.923
Now, at the whim of a madman, it will fall.

480
00:48:13.144 --> 00:48:15.350
And the White Tree, the tree of the king...

481
00:48:15.521 --> 00:48:17.064
will never bloom again.

482
00:48:17.231 --> 00:48:20.600
- Why are they still guarding it?
- They guard it because they have hope.

483
00:48:20.777 --> 00:48:23.943
A faint and fading hope that one day it will flower.

484
00:48:24.113 --> 00:48:28.858
That a king will come and this
city will be as it once was...

485
00:48:29.035 --> 00:48:31.951
before it fell into decay.

486
00:48:32.121 --> 00:48:35.371
The old wisdom borne out of the West was forsaken.

487
00:48:35.540 --> 00:48:39.834
Kings made tombs more splendid
than the houses of the living...

488
00:48:40.045 --> 00:48:41.954
and counted the old names of their descent...

489
00:48:42.130 --> 00:48:44.917
dearer than the names of their sons.

490
00:48:45.092 --> 00:48:50.132
Childless lords sat in aged
halls, musing on heraldry...

491
00:48:50.305 --> 00:48:55.644
or in high, cold towers, asking questions of the stars.

492
00:48:55.810 --> 00:48:59.594
And so the people of Gondor fell into ruin.

493
00:49:00.565 --> 00:49:02.890
The line of kings failed.

494
00:49:03.609 --> 00:49:05.981
The White Tree withered.

495
00:49:06.695 --> 00:49:10.859
The rule of Gondor was given over to lesser men.

496
00:49:21.585 --> 00:49:22.830
Mordor.

497
00:49:23.337 --> 00:49:27.002
Yes, there it lies.

498
00:49:27.841 --> 00:49:31.175
This city has dwelt ever in the sight of its shadow.

499
00:49:33.179 --> 00:49:34.839
A storm is coming.

500
00:49:35.515 --> 00:49:38.433
This is not the weather of the world.

501
00:49:38.601 --> 00:49:40.808
This is a device of Sauron's making.

502
00:49:40.979 --> 00:49:44.727
A broil of fume he sends ahead of his host.

503
00:49:45.316 --> 00:49:47.771
The Orcs of Mordor have no love of daylight...

504
00:49:47.944 --> 00:49:49.771
so he covers the face of the sun...

505
00:49:49.946 --> 00:49:53.694
to ease their passage along the road to war.

506
00:49:53.867 --> 00:49:57.152
When the Shadow of Mordor reaches this city...

507
00:49:57.870 --> 00:49:59.578
it will begin.

508
00:50:01.248 --> 00:50:02.826
Well...

509
00:50:03.209 --> 00:50:04.537
Minas Tirith...

510
00:50:06.462 --> 00:50:07.873
very impressive.

511
00:50:08.046 --> 00:50:10.668
- So where are we off to next?
- Oh, it's too late for that, Peregrin.

512
00:50:10.841 --> 00:50:13.048
There's no leaving this city.

513
00:50:15.387 --> 00:50:18.590
Help must come to us.

514
00:50:20.100 --> 00:50:22.770
It must be getting near teatime.

515
00:50:22.936 --> 00:50:26.637
Leastways, it would be in decent
places where there is still teatime.

516
00:50:26.815 --> 00:50:30.398
We're not in decent places.

517
00:50:35.949 --> 00:50:37.194
Mr. Frodo?

518
00:50:40.245 --> 00:50:41.442
What is it?

519
00:50:43.915 --> 00:50:46.287
It's just a feeling.

520
00:50:48.711 --> 00:50:50.870
I don't think I'll be coming back.

521
00:50:55.385 --> 00:50:57.922
Yes, you will. Of course you will.

522
00:50:58.554 --> 00:51:00.427
That's just morbid thinking.

523
00:51:00.890 --> 00:51:03.345
We're going there and back again...

524
00:51:03.517 --> 00:51:05.806
just like Mr. Bilbo.

525
00:51:06.771 --> 00:51:08.894
You'll see.

526
00:51:17.072 --> 00:51:20.690
I think these lands were once
part of the kingdom of Gondor.

527
00:51:25.080 --> 00:51:29.124
Long ago, when there was a king.

528
00:51:49.771 --> 00:51:52.605
Mr. Frodo, look.

529
00:51:54.232 --> 00:51:56.984
The king has got a crown again.

530
00:52:08.122 --> 00:52:12.368
Come on, Hobbits! Mustn't stop now. This way.

531
00:52:29.225 --> 00:52:33.270
So I imagine this is just a ceremonial position.

532
00:52:33.437 --> 00:52:37.685
I mean, they don't actually
expect me to do any fighting.

533
00:52:38.526 --> 00:52:41.776
- Do they?
- You're in the service of the steward now.

534
00:52:41.945 --> 00:52:45.315
You'll have to do as you're told, Peregrin Took.

535
00:52:49.369 --> 00:52:51.861
Ridiculous Hobbit.

536
00:52:53.040 --> 00:52:55.246
Guard of the Citadel.

537
00:53:04.760 --> 00:53:06.586
Thank you.

538
00:53:15.978 --> 00:53:18.220
There's no more stars.

539
00:53:18.731 --> 00:53:19.930
Is it time?

540
00:53:21.109 --> 00:53:22.852
Yes.

541
00:53:25.488 --> 00:53:27.148
It's so quiet.

542
00:53:28.157 --> 00:53:32.404
It's the deep breath before the plunge.

543
00:53:33.580 --> 00:53:36.449
I don't want to be in a battle...

544
00:53:37.292 --> 00:53:42.249
but waiting on the edge of one
I can't escape is even worse.

545
00:53:45.800 --> 00:53:49.418
Is there any hope, Gandalf, for Frodo and Sam?

546
00:53:50.762 --> 00:53:53.882
There never was much hope.

547
00:53:55.851 --> 00:53:57.594
Just a fool's hope.

548
00:54:03.483 --> 00:54:06.270
Our enemy is ready.

549
00:54:06.444 --> 00:54:09.114
His full strength's gathered.

550
00:54:09.281 --> 00:54:12.779
Not only Orcs, but Men as well.

551
00:54:12.951 --> 00:54:15.987
Legions of Haradrim from the south...

552
00:54:16.162 --> 00:54:18.866
mercenaries from the coast.

553
00:54:19.040 --> 00:54:21.613
All will answer Mordor's call.

554
00:54:21.792 --> 00:54:23.334
Come on.

555
00:54:24.462 --> 00:54:27.795
This will be the end of Gondor as we know it.

556
00:54:27.965 --> 00:54:31.334
Here the hammer stroke will fall hardest.

557
00:54:32.303 --> 00:54:36.632
If the river is taken, if the
garrison at Osgiliath falls...

558
00:54:36.807 --> 00:54:40.472
the last defense of this city will be gone.

559
00:54:40.644 --> 00:54:44.689
But we have the White Wizard.
That's got to count for something.

560
00:54:50.570 --> 00:54:52.148
Gandalf?

561
00:54:55.867 --> 00:54:59.532
Sauron has yet to reveal his deadliest servant...

562
00:54:59.996 --> 00:55:03.828
the one who will lead Mordor's armies in war.

563
00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:09.160
The one they say no living man can kill.

564
00:55:10.173 --> 00:55:12.331
The Witch King of Angmar.

565
00:55:13.425 --> 00:55:15.798
You've met him before.

566
00:55:16.470 --> 00:55:19.044
He stabbed Frodo on Weathertop.

567
00:55:25.605 --> 00:55:28.309
He is the lord of the Nazgul...

568
00:55:28.774 --> 00:55:31.230
the greatest of the Nine.

569
00:55:31.401 --> 00:55:35.020
Minas Morgul is his lair.

570
00:55:38.492 --> 00:55:42.026
The Dead City.

571
00:55:42.203 --> 00:55:47.411
Very nasty place. Full of enemies.

572
00:55:54.633 --> 00:55:56.791
Quick. Quick.

573
00:55:56.968 --> 00:56:00.965
They will see. They will see.

574
00:56:10.230 --> 00:56:15.521
Come away. Come away. Look, we have found it.

575
00:56:15.695 --> 00:56:19.562
The way into Mordor.

576
00:56:19.740 --> 00:56:24.070
The secret stair.

577
00:56:24.494 --> 00:56:26.866
Climb.

578
00:56:47.141 --> 00:56:49.893
- No, Mr. Frodo!
- Not that way!

579
00:56:54.732 --> 00:56:57.603
- What's it doing?
- No.

580
00:56:57.777 --> 00:57:00.861
- They're calling me.
- No.

581
00:57:30.517 --> 00:57:33.471
Hide! Hide!

582
00:58:17.021 --> 00:58:19.856
I can feel his blade.

583
00:58:31.534 --> 00:58:33.658
We come to it at last.

584
00:58:35.496 --> 00:58:38.367
The great battle of our time.

585
00:59:17.538 --> 00:59:20.787
Come away, Hobbits. We climb. We must climb.

586
00:59:30.675 --> 00:59:33.676
The board is set.

587
00:59:33.844 --> 00:59:36.383
The pieces are moving.

588
00:59:38.933 --> 00:59:41.603
Up, up, up the stairs we go.

589
00:59:41.769 --> 00:59:44.438
And then it's into the tunnel.

590
00:59:44.605 --> 00:59:47.809
Hey, what's in this tunnel?

591
00:59:48.358 --> 00:59:51.110
You listen to me, and you listen good and proper.

592
00:59:51.278 --> 00:59:54.196
Anything happens to him, you have me to answer to.

593
00:59:54.364 --> 00:59:55.942
One sniff something's not right...

594
00:59:56.117 --> 00:59:59.283
one hair stands up on the back of my head, it's over.

595
00:59:59.494 --> 01:00:02.164
No more slinker. No more stinker.

596
01:00:02.497 --> 01:00:05.119
You're gone. Got it?

597
01:00:06.001 --> 01:00:07.993
I'm watching you.

598
01:00:13.341 --> 01:00:15.334
What was that about?

599
01:00:15.510 --> 01:00:17.917
Nothing. Just clearing something up.

600
01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:27.431
Peregrin Took, my lad, there is a task now to be done.

601
01:00:27.605 --> 01:00:32.183
Another opportunity for one of the
Shire-folk to prove their great worth.

602
01:00:37.031 --> 01:00:38.609
You must not fail me.

603
01:01:12.857 --> 01:01:15.941
It's been very quiet across the river.

604
01:01:16.110 --> 01:01:18.435
The Orcs are lying low.

605
01:01:18.613 --> 01:01:20.605
The garrison may have moved out.

606
01:01:21.741 --> 01:01:24.445
We've sent scouts to Cair Andros.

607
01:01:24.619 --> 01:01:27.904
If the Orcs attack from the
north, we'll have some warning.

608
01:01:53.229 --> 01:01:54.428
Quiet.

609
01:01:58.526 --> 01:02:00.484
We need 10 more.

610
01:02:21.799 --> 01:02:23.341
Kill him!

611
01:02:40.651 --> 01:02:43.058
They're not coming from the north.

612
01:02:44.488 --> 01:02:48.817
To the river. Quick. Quick. Go. Come on.

613
01:02:52.287 --> 01:02:53.864
Faster.

614
01:03:07.010 --> 01:03:09.382
Draw swords.

615
01:04:03.940 --> 01:04:06.513
Hold! Hold them!

616
01:05:26.811 --> 01:05:28.686
What?

617
01:05:41.242 --> 01:05:42.653
Amon Din

618
01:05:48.458 --> 01:05:51.494
The beacon. The beacon of Amon Din is lit.

619
01:05:54.755 --> 01:05:58.967
Hope is kindled.

620
01:07:31.349 --> 01:07:35.727
The beacons of Minas Tirith! The beacons are lit!

621
01:07:36.938 --> 01:07:38.562
Gondor calls for aid.

622
01:07:49.074 --> 01:07:51.992
And Rohan will answer.

623
01:07:52.411 --> 01:07:55.198
Muster the Rohirrim.

624
01:08:10.303 --> 01:08:12.261
Assemble the army at Dunharrow.

625
01:08:12.430 --> 01:08:16.808
As many men as can be found. You have two days.

626
01:08:16.976 --> 01:08:22.267
On the third, we ride for Gondor and war.

627
01:08:23.232 --> 01:08:24.561
- Forward.
- Very good, sir.

628
01:08:24.734 --> 01:08:26.062
- Gamling.
- My lord.

629
01:08:26.235 --> 01:08:27.813
Make haste across the Riddermark.

630
01:08:27.988 --> 01:08:30.110
Summon every able-bodied man to Dunharrow.

631
01:08:30.281 --> 01:08:31.859
I will.

632
01:08:35.953 --> 01:08:39.120
- Will you ride with us?
- Just to the encampment.

633
01:08:39.289 --> 01:08:43.204
It's tradition for the women of
the court to farewell the men.

634
01:08:49.758 --> 01:08:51.668
The men have found their captain.

635
01:08:51.844 --> 01:08:55.177
They will follow you into battle, even to death.

636
01:08:55.347 --> 01:08:56.925
You have given us hope.

637
01:09:00.143 --> 01:09:02.101
Excuse me.

638
01:09:03.438 --> 01:09:04.932
I have a sword.

639
01:09:05.232 --> 01:09:06.607
Please accept it.

640
01:09:07.734 --> 01:09:12.230
I offer you my service, Theoden King.

641
01:09:15.658 --> 01:09:17.734
And gladly I accept it.

642
01:09:18.828 --> 01:09:22.908
You shall be Meriadoc, esquire of Rohan.

643
01:09:27.795 --> 01:09:28.993
Horse-Men.

644
01:09:29.672 --> 01:09:35.295
I wish I could muster a legion of
Dwarves, fully armed and filthy.

645
01:09:35.678 --> 01:09:38.632
Your kinsmen may have no need to ride to war.

646
01:09:38.806 --> 01:09:42.222
I fear war already marches on their own lands.

647
01:10:00.702 --> 01:10:04.153
So it is before the walls of Minas Tirith...

648
01:10:04.331 --> 01:10:08.198
the doom of our time will be decided.

649
01:10:10.795 --> 01:10:16.335
Now is the hour. Riders of Rohan, oaths you have taken.

650
01:10:16.509 --> 01:10:20.043
Now, fulfill them all. To lord and land!

651
01:11:03.137 --> 01:11:05.095
Faramir!

652
01:11:11.395 --> 01:11:15.096
We can't hold them. The city is lost.

653
01:11:15.691 --> 01:11:18.775
Tell the men to break cover. We ride for Minas Tirith.

654
01:11:27.536 --> 01:11:29.778
Nazgul.

655
01:11:32.166 --> 01:11:34.621
Take cover!

656
01:11:34.793 --> 01:11:37.331
Nazgul!

657
01:11:37.504 --> 01:11:41.169
Fall back. Fall back to Minas Tirith!

658
01:11:47.764 --> 01:11:49.638
Fall back!

659
01:11:56.689 --> 01:12:01.268
- Retreat! Retreat!
- Run for your lives!

660
01:12:25.509 --> 01:12:29.838
The age of Men is over.

661
01:12:30.013 --> 01:12:35.636
The time of the Orc has come.

662
01:12:38.021 --> 01:12:40.346
- Keep going.
- It's the Nazgul.

663
01:12:41.983 --> 01:12:44.355
Take cover, my lord!

664
01:12:44.652 --> 01:12:45.981
It's coming!

665
01:12:51.534 --> 01:12:54.903
- It's Mithrandir.
- The White Rider!

666
01:13:34.868 --> 01:13:36.243
Pull!

667
01:13:53.970 --> 01:13:56.377
Mithrandir.

668
01:13:56.555 --> 01:13:58.299
They broke through our defenses.

669
01:13:58.474 --> 01:14:00.680
They've taken the bridge and the west bank.

670
01:14:01.769 --> 01:14:05.932
- Battalions of Orcs are crossing the river.
- It is as the Lord Denethor predicted.

671
01:14:06.106 --> 01:14:10.649
- Long has he foreseen this doom.
- Foreseen and done nothing.

672
01:14:14.030 --> 01:14:16.439
Faramir?

673
01:14:18.368 --> 01:14:22.200
This is not the first Halfling
to have crossed your path.

674
01:14:22.372 --> 01:14:24.578
No.

675
01:14:25.917 --> 01:14:27.459
You've seen Frodo and Sam?

676
01:14:28.336 --> 01:14:31.752
- Where? When?
- In Ithilien.

677
01:14:31.923 --> 01:14:33.999
Not two days ago.

678
01:14:34.467 --> 01:14:38.927
Gandalf, they're taking the road to the Morgul Vale.

679
01:14:39.639 --> 01:14:42.260
And then the pass of Cirith Ungol.

680
01:14:44.477 --> 01:14:46.849
What does that mean?

681
01:14:47.021 --> 01:14:51.931
- What's wrong?
- Faramir, tell me everything.

682
01:14:52.109 --> 01:14:54.148
Tell me all you know.

683
01:14:55.321 --> 01:14:58.736
This is how you would serve your city?

684
01:14:58.908 --> 01:15:02.193
You would risk its utter ruin?

685
01:15:03.245 --> 01:15:04.822
I did what I judged to be right.

686
01:15:05.538 --> 01:15:08.539
What you judged to be right.

687
01:15:09.167 --> 01:15:15.040
You sent the Ring of Power into Mordor
in the hands of a witless Halfling.

688
01:15:19.010 --> 01:15:23.838
It should have been brought back
to the Citadel to be kept safe.

689
01:15:25.475 --> 01:15:27.017
Hidden.

690
01:15:27.435 --> 01:15:30.187
Dark and deep in the vaults...

691
01:15:30.354 --> 01:15:32.513
not to be used.

692
01:15:36.694 --> 01:15:41.570
Unless at the uttermost end of need.

693
01:15:42.033 --> 01:15:44.072
I would not use the Ring.

694
01:15:44.243 --> 01:15:47.328
Not if Minas Tirith were falling
in ruin and I alone could save her.

695
01:15:47.663 --> 01:15:52.490
Ever you desire to appear lordly and gracious...

696
01:15:52.668 --> 01:15:54.910
as a king of old.

697
01:15:56.713 --> 01:16:00.462
Boromir would have remembered his father's need.

698
01:16:00.884 --> 01:16:03.340
He would have brought me a kingly gift.

699
01:16:03.553 --> 01:16:06.091
Boromir would not have brought the Ring.

700
01:16:06.515 --> 01:16:09.634
He would have stretched out his hand to
this thing and taken it. He would've fallen.

701
01:16:09.809 --> 01:16:12.051
- You know nothing of this matter!
- He would have kept it for his own.

702
01:16:13.939 --> 01:16:16.097
And when he returned...

703
01:16:17.233 --> 01:16:18.893
you would not have known your son.

704
01:16:19.068 --> 01:16:21.606
Boromir was loyal to me!

705
01:16:21.779 --> 01:16:24.352
Not some wizard's pupil!

706
01:16:32.498 --> 01:16:33.826
Father?

707
01:16:46.512 --> 01:16:48.421
My son.

708
01:17:14.664 --> 01:17:16.039
Leave me.

709
01:17:49.614 --> 01:17:52.152
Careful, master. Careful.

710
01:17:52.492 --> 01:17:55.410
Very far to fall.

711
01:17:57.914 --> 01:18:01.828
Very dangerous are the stairs.

712
01:18:04.504 --> 01:18:07.042
Come, master.

713
01:18:12.846 --> 01:18:16.012
Come to Smeagol.

714
01:18:22.354 --> 01:18:23.848
Mr. Frodo.

715
01:18:24.857 --> 01:18:26.399
Get back, you!

716
01:18:26.567 --> 01:18:28.773
Don't touch him!

717
01:18:32.906 --> 01:18:35.741
Why does he hates poor Smeagol?

718
01:18:35.909 --> 01:18:39.610
What has Smeagol ever done to him?

719
01:18:39.788 --> 01:18:42.160
Master?

720
01:18:42.957 --> 01:18:46.409
Master carries heavy burden.

721
01:18:46.586 --> 01:18:52.007
Smeagol knows. Heavy, heavy burden.

722
01:18:52.175 --> 01:18:55.425
Fat one cannot know.

723
01:18:57.472 --> 01:19:00.223
Smeagol look after master.

724
01:19:01.434 --> 01:19:03.641
He wants it.

725
01:19:03.811 --> 01:19:08.354
He needs it. Smeagol sees it in his eye.

726
01:19:08.524 --> 01:19:13.980
Very soon he will ask you for it. You will see.

727
01:19:14.155 --> 01:19:18.022
The fat one will take it from you.

728
01:19:25.248 --> 01:19:29.578
Send forth all legions.

729
01:19:29.753 --> 01:19:33.798
Do not stop the attack until the city is taken.

730
01:19:34.508 --> 01:19:37.628
Slay them all.

731
01:19:39.304 --> 01:19:45.093
- What of the wizard?
- I will break him.

732
01:19:48.438 --> 01:19:50.845
Where are Theoden's riders?

733
01:19:51.023 --> 01:19:53.597
Will Rohan's army come?

734
01:19:53.776 --> 01:19:56.018
Mithrandir.

735
01:19:57.071 --> 01:20:00.938
Courage is the best defense that you have now.

736
01:20:05.747 --> 01:20:08.451
What were you thinking, Peregrin Took?

737
01:20:10.542 --> 01:20:16.248
What service can a Hobbit
offer such a great lord of Men?

738
01:20:16.423 --> 01:20:17.918
It was well-done.

739
01:20:21.094 --> 01:20:25.139
A generous deed should not
be checked with cold counsel.

740
01:20:25.890 --> 01:20:28.429
You are to join the tower guard.

741
01:20:28.977 --> 01:20:31.977
I didn't think they would find
any livery that would fit me.

742
01:20:32.147 --> 01:20:34.602
Once belonged to a young boy of the city.

743
01:20:34.774 --> 01:20:36.316
A very foolish one...

744
01:20:36.484 --> 01:20:40.731
who wasted many hours slaying dragons
instead of attending to his studies.

745
01:20:40.905 --> 01:20:43.657
- This was yours?
- Yes, it was mine.

746
01:20:43.825 --> 01:20:45.616
My father had it made for me.

747
01:20:46.661 --> 01:20:47.990
Well...

748
01:20:48.163 --> 01:20:50.154
I'm taller than you were then.

749
01:20:50.331 --> 01:20:53.665
Though I'm not likely to grow anymore, except sideways.

750
01:20:56.629 --> 01:20:58.669
Never fitted me either.

751
01:20:58.839 --> 01:21:01.675
Boromir was always the soldier.

752
01:21:04.679 --> 01:21:07.086
They were so alike, he and my father.

753
01:21:09.183 --> 01:21:10.808
Proud.

754
01:21:10.976 --> 01:21:12.174
Stubborn even.

755
01:21:13.938 --> 01:21:15.432
But strong.

756
01:21:16.940 --> 01:21:20.107
I think you have strength of a different kind.

757
01:21:20.736 --> 01:21:23.191
And one day your father will see it.

758
01:21:27.367 --> 01:21:31.151
Here do I swear fealty and service to Gondor...

759
01:21:31.329 --> 01:21:32.824
in peace or war...

760
01:21:33.457 --> 01:21:35.912
in living or dying...

761
01:21:37.294 --> 01:21:38.538
from...

762
01:21:41.214 --> 01:21:44.001
From this hour henceforth...

763
01:21:44.175 --> 01:21:46.084
until my lord release me...

764
01:21:47.595 --> 01:21:49.801
or death take me.

765
01:21:50.389 --> 01:21:52.880
And I shall not forget it...

766
01:21:53.058 --> 01:21:56.428
nor fail to reward that which is given.

767
01:22:04.028 --> 01:22:06.316
Fealty with love.

768
01:22:07.405 --> 01:22:09.066
Valor with honor.

769
01:22:10.659 --> 01:22:13.992
Disloyalty with vengeance.

770
01:22:22.629 --> 01:22:26.709
I do not think we should so lightly
abandon the outer defenses...

771
01:22:26.883 --> 01:22:29.635
defenses that your brother long held intact.

772
01:22:29.802 --> 01:22:32.293
- What would you have me do?
- I will not yield...

773
01:22:32.472 --> 01:22:35.259
the river in Pelennor unfought.

774
01:22:35.433 --> 01:22:37.093
Osgiliath must be retaken.

775
01:22:37.268 --> 01:22:39.308
My lord, Osgiliath is overrun.

776
01:22:39.979 --> 01:22:42.766
Much must be risked in war.

777
01:22:45.401 --> 01:22:49.351
Is there a captain here who still
has the courage to do his lord's will?

778
01:22:55.577 --> 01:22:58.827
You wish now that our places had been exchanged...

779
01:22:59.790 --> 01:23:02.625
that I had died and Boromir had lived.

780
01:23:06.046 --> 01:23:07.789
Yes.

781
01:23:08.465 --> 01:23:10.671
I wish that.

782
01:23:19.058 --> 01:23:21.549
Since you were robbed of Boromir...

783
01:23:23.396 --> 01:23:26.314
I will do what I can in his stead.

784
01:23:34.490 --> 01:23:38.950
If I should return, think better of me, Father.

785
01:23:41.038 --> 01:23:44.656
That will depend on the manner of your return.

786
01:25:07.956 --> 01:25:10.281
What are you up to?

787
01:25:10.458 --> 01:25:11.703
Sneaking off, are we?

788
01:25:12.419 --> 01:25:14.245
Sneaking?

789
01:25:15.254 --> 01:25:17.412
Sneaking?

790
01:25:18.841 --> 01:25:22.007
Fat Hobbit is always so polite.

791
01:25:22.178 --> 01:25:27.254
Smeagol shows them secret ways
that nobody else could find...

792
01:25:27.433 --> 01:25:29.591
and they say "sneak."

793
01:25:30.227 --> 01:25:32.801
Sneak?

794
01:25:33.438 --> 01:25:36.143
Very nice friend. Oh, yes, my precious.

795
01:25:36.316 --> 01:25:38.938
- Very nice, very nice.
- All right. All right!

796
01:25:40.195 --> 01:25:42.401
You just startled me is all.

797
01:25:42.906 --> 01:25:44.733
What were you doing?

798
01:25:46.368 --> 01:25:48.490
Sneaking.

799
01:25:48.870 --> 01:25:51.955
Fine. Have it your own way.

800
01:25:54.209 --> 01:25:56.700
I'm sorry to wake you, Mr. Frodo.

801
01:25:57.087 --> 01:25:59.043
We have to be moving on.

802
01:26:04.218 --> 01:26:05.796
It's dark still.

803
01:26:05.970 --> 01:26:08.176
It's always dark here.

804
01:26:12.435 --> 01:26:14.343
It's gone!

805
01:26:15.563 --> 01:26:18.433
- The Elven bread.
- What?

806
01:26:18.607 --> 01:26:20.066
That's all we have left.

807
01:26:24.154 --> 01:26:26.646
He took it. He must have!

808
01:26:27.157 --> 01:26:30.408
Smeagol? No, no, not poor Smeagol.

809
01:26:30.577 --> 01:26:33.495
Smeagol hates nasty Elf bread.

810
01:26:33.664 --> 01:26:36.830
You're a lying rat! What did you do with it?!

811
01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:38.542
He doesn't eat it.

812
01:26:39.545 --> 01:26:41.870
- He can't have taken it.
- Look.

813
01:26:42.922 --> 01:26:44.750
What's this?

814
01:26:47.427 --> 01:26:50.761
Crumbs on his jacketses. He took it!

815
01:26:51.472 --> 01:26:53.133
He took it.

816
01:26:53.975 --> 01:26:58.186
I seen him. He's always stuffing
his face when master's not looking.

817
01:26:58.355 --> 01:27:00.146
That's a filthy lie!

818
01:27:00.314 --> 01:27:02.521
You stinking, two-faced sneak!

819
01:27:02.691 --> 01:27:03.937
- Sam!
- Call me...

820
01:27:04.110 --> 01:27:05.355
Stop it!

821
01:27:06.362 --> 01:27:07.560
Sam!

822
01:27:08.864 --> 01:27:12.482
- I'll kill him!
- Sam! No!

823
01:27:13.536 --> 01:27:19.075
Oh, my... I'm sorry. I didn't mean it
to go so far. I was just so... So angry.

824
01:27:19.249 --> 01:27:21.372
Here, just... Let's
just rest a bit.

825
01:27:21.543 --> 01:27:23.619
- I'm all right.
- No.

826
01:27:23.795 --> 01:27:26.880
No, you're not all right. You're exhausted.

827
01:27:27.048 --> 01:27:29.171
It's that Gollum.

828
01:27:29.342 --> 01:27:31.051
It's this place.

829
01:27:31.219 --> 01:27:33.792
It's that thing around your neck.

830
01:27:37.309 --> 01:27:38.589
I could help a bit.

831
01:27:38.768 --> 01:27:41.437
I could carry it for a while.

832
01:27:41.605 --> 01:27:43.348
Carry it for a while.

833
01:27:43.523 --> 01:27:44.768
I could carry it... I could carry it.

834
01:27:45.400 --> 01:27:50.856
Share the load... Share the
load... the load... the load.

835
01:27:51.030 --> 01:27:52.229
Get away!

836
01:27:52.407 --> 01:27:53.984
I don't want to keep it.

837
01:27:57.579 --> 01:27:59.570
I just want to help.

838
01:28:01.624 --> 01:28:04.246
See? See?

839
01:28:04.418 --> 01:28:07.834
He wants it for himself.

840
01:28:08.006 --> 01:28:09.713
Shut up, you!

841
01:28:10.257 --> 01:28:12.084
Go away! Get out of here!

842
01:28:12.259 --> 01:28:14.086
No, Sam.

843
01:28:14.261 --> 01:28:15.506
It's you.

844
01:28:19.725 --> 01:28:21.432
I'm sorry, Sam.

845
01:28:23.103 --> 01:28:24.478
But he's a liar.

846
01:28:24.646 --> 01:28:27.315
He's poisoned you against me.

847
01:28:28.734 --> 01:28:30.642
You can't help me anymore.

848
01:28:32.612 --> 01:28:34.485
You don't mean that.

849
01:28:36.992 --> 01:28:38.783
Go home.

850
01:29:58.821 --> 01:30:00.612
Faramir!

851
01:30:00.781 --> 01:30:02.690
Faramir!

852
01:30:04.201 --> 01:30:06.241
Your father's will has turned to madness.

853
01:30:07.412 --> 01:30:09.452
Do not throw away your life so rashly.

854
01:30:10.207 --> 01:30:12.532
Where does my allegiance lie if not here?

855
01:30:13.168 --> 01:30:16.086
This is the city of the Men of Numenor.

856
01:30:16.713 --> 01:30:19.500
I will gladly give my life to defend her beauty...

857
01:30:19.674 --> 01:30:22.878
her memory, her wisdom.

858
01:30:25.263 --> 01:30:28.679
Your father loves you, Faramir.

859
01:30:29.392 --> 01:30:32.393
He will remember it before the end.

860
01:31:42.004 --> 01:31:43.546
Can you sing, Master Hobbit?

861
01:31:46.529 --> 01:31:48.023
Well...

862
01:31:48.573 --> 01:31:50.197
yes.

863
01:31:50.909 --> 01:31:54.657
At least, well enough for my own people.

864
01:31:56.289 --> 01:31:58.696
But we have no songs for great halls...

865
01:31:59.750 --> 01:32:00.995
and evil times.

866
01:32:01.835 --> 01:32:05.002
And why should your songs be unfit for my halls?

867
01:32:07.800 --> 01:32:09.211
Come, sing me a song.

868
01:32:20.271 --> 01:32:23.604
Home is behind

869
01:32:23.773 --> 01:32:27.522
The world ahead

870
01:32:29.946 --> 01:32:35.782
And there are many paths to tread

871
01:32:37.578 --> 01:32:41.113
Through shadow

872
01:32:41.290 --> 01:32:45.454
To the edge of night

873
01:32:47.129 --> 01:32:52.207
Until the stars are all alight

874
01:32:55.221 --> 01:32:59.549
Mist and shadow

875
01:32:59.725 --> 01:33:04.018
Cloud and shade

876
01:33:06.398 --> 01:33:09.732
All shall fade

877
01:33:12.112 --> 01:33:16.109
All shall

878
01:33:21.872 --> 01:33:24.244
Fade

879
01:33:48.647 --> 01:33:52.099
March! March!

880
01:33:52.276 --> 01:33:57.483
March! March! March!

881
01:34:00.952 --> 01:34:03.277
Make way for the king.

882
01:34:04.789 --> 01:34:06.780
Make way.

883
01:34:09.250 --> 01:34:11.290
The king is here.

884
01:34:13.255 --> 01:34:14.879
My lord.

885
01:34:16.133 --> 01:34:18.089
Hail to you, sire.

886
01:34:18.552 --> 01:34:19.749
Grimbold, how many?

887
01:34:19.928 --> 01:34:22.383
I bring 500 men from the Westfold, my lord.

888
01:34:23.348 --> 01:34:26.017
We have 300 more from Fenmarch, Theoden King.

889
01:34:27.143 --> 01:34:31.092
- Where are the riders from Snowborn?
- None have come, my lord.

890
01:34:48.164 --> 01:34:50.287
Six thousand spears.

891
01:34:51.333 --> 01:34:53.326
Less than half of what I'd hoped for.

892
01:34:53.627 --> 01:34:56.996
Six thousand will not be enough
to break the lines of Mordor.

893
01:34:59.758 --> 01:35:01.501
More will come.

894
01:35:01.885 --> 01:35:04.839
Every hour lost hastens Gondor's defeat.

895
01:35:05.013 --> 01:35:07.586
We have till dawn, then we must ride.

896
01:35:27.076 --> 01:35:29.401
The horses are restless...

897
01:35:29.579 --> 01:35:31.073
and the men are quiet.

898
01:35:31.539 --> 01:35:34.658
They grow nervous in the shadow of the mountain.

899
01:35:37.128 --> 01:35:39.001
That road there...

900
01:35:39.922 --> 01:35:41.998
where does that lead?

901
01:35:42.758 --> 01:35:46.590
It is the road to the Dimholt,
the door under the mountain.

902
01:35:47.304 --> 01:35:50.305
None who venture there ever return.

903
01:35:51.516 --> 01:35:53.390
That mountain is evil.

904
01:36:16.332 --> 01:36:18.159
Aragorn.

905
01:36:18.918 --> 01:36:20.827
Let's find some food.

906
01:36:37.311 --> 01:36:38.722
There.

907
01:36:39.688 --> 01:36:42.689
A true esquire of Rohan.

908
01:36:46.320 --> 01:36:48.312
I'm ready.

909
01:36:49.907 --> 01:36:51.186
Sorry.

910
01:36:51.367 --> 01:36:53.607
It isn't all that dangerous.

911
01:36:54.119 --> 01:36:56.444
It's not even sharp.

912
01:36:57.122 --> 01:37:00.538
Well, that's no good. You won't
kill many Orcs with a blunt blade.

913
01:37:00.709 --> 01:37:02.203
Come on.

914
01:37:06.380 --> 01:37:08.872
To the smithy. Go!

915
01:37:10.343 --> 01:37:12.881
You should not encourage him.

916
01:37:13.054 --> 01:37:15.509
You should not doubt him.

917
01:37:15.682 --> 01:37:18.967
I do not doubt his heart, only the reach of his arm.

918
01:37:21.688 --> 01:37:23.265
Why should Merry be left behind?

919
01:37:23.439 --> 01:37:26.060
He has as much cause to go to war as you.

920
01:37:28.235 --> 01:37:31.401
Why can he not fight for those he loves?

921
01:37:34.658 --> 01:37:37.659
You know as little of war as that Hobbit.

922
01:37:38.912 --> 01:37:40.988
When the fear takes him...

923
01:37:41.164 --> 01:37:46.206
and the blood and the screams and
the horror of battle take hold...

924
01:37:46.586 --> 01:37:48.744
do you think he would stand and fight?

925
01:37:51.299 --> 01:37:52.924
He would flee.

926
01:37:53.093 --> 01:37:55.132
And he would be right to do so.

927
01:37:57.347 --> 01:38:01.297
War is the province of Men, Eowyn.

928
01:38:36.968 --> 01:38:40.669
I choose a mortal life.

929
01:38:43.600 --> 01:38:46.470
I wish I could've seen him...

930
01:38:47.604 --> 01:38:50.309
one last time.

931
01:39:01.492 --> 01:39:02.903
Sir?

932
01:39:04.746 --> 01:39:07.319
King Theoden awaits you, my lord.

933
01:39:28.101 --> 01:39:30.058
I take my leave.

934
01:39:44.700 --> 01:39:45.946
My lord Elrond.

935
01:39:46.536 --> 01:39:50.035
I come on behalf of one whom I love.

936
01:39:53.125 --> 01:39:55.118
Arwen is dying.

937
01:39:59.923 --> 01:40:03.968
She will not long survive the
evil that now spreads from Mordor.

938
01:40:04.720 --> 01:40:08.089
The light of the Evenstar is failing.

939
01:40:08.265 --> 01:40:12.263
As Sauron's power grows, her strength wanes.

940
01:40:12.436 --> 01:40:16.184
Arwen's life is now tied to the fate of the Ring.

941
01:40:16.940 --> 01:40:19.513
The Shadow is upon us, Aragorn.

942
01:40:19.902 --> 01:40:21.561
The end has come.

943
01:40:21.946 --> 01:40:24.566
It will not be our end, but his.

944
01:40:25.323 --> 01:40:28.906
You ride to war, but not to victory.

945
01:40:29.911 --> 01:40:33.576
Sauron's armies march on Minas Tirith, this you know.

946
01:40:33.748 --> 01:40:38.161
But in secret he sends another force
which will attack from the river.

947
01:40:38.628 --> 01:40:42.044
A fleet of Corsair ships sails from the south.

948
01:40:42.674 --> 01:40:44.750
They'll be in the city in two days.

949
01:40:45.259 --> 01:40:48.094
You're outnumbered, Aragorn.

950
01:40:48.804 --> 01:40:50.928
You need more men.

951
01:40:51.307 --> 01:40:53.051
There are none.

952
01:40:54.810 --> 01:40:58.724
There are those who dwell in the mountain.

953
01:41:07.739 --> 01:41:09.898
Murderers...

954
01:41:10.075 --> 01:41:11.486
traitors.

955
01:41:13.954 --> 01:41:16.112
You would call upon them to fight?

956
01:41:16.289 --> 01:41:17.867
They believe in nothing.

957
01:41:18.041 --> 01:41:20.164
They answer to no one.

958
01:41:20.335 --> 01:41:23.419
They will answer to the king of Gondor.

959
01:41:30.553 --> 01:41:35.678
Anduril, the Flame of the West,
forged from the shards of Narsil.

960
01:41:49.989 --> 01:41:54.402
Sauron will not have forgotten the Sword of Elendil.

961
01:42:08.465 --> 01:42:13.210
The blade that was broken shall return to Minas Tirith.

962
01:42:13.387 --> 01:42:15.794
The man who can wield the power of this sword...

963
01:42:15.972 --> 01:42:19.839
can summon to him an army more
deadly than any that walks this earth.

964
01:42:21.686 --> 01:42:23.844
Put aside the Ranger.

965
01:42:24.022 --> 01:42:27.355
Become who you were born to be.

966
01:42:27.525 --> 01:42:29.518
Take the Dimholt road.

967
01:42:33.531 --> 01:42:36.318
I give hope to Men.

968
01:42:39.578 --> 01:42:43.707
I keep none for myself.

969
01:42:55.552 --> 01:42:57.213
Why are you doing this?

970
01:42:57.679 --> 01:43:00.882
The war lies to the east. You
cannot leave on the eve of battle.

971
01:43:03.310 --> 01:43:05.385
You cannot abandon the men.

972
01:43:06.688 --> 01:43:08.265
Eowyn...

973
01:43:08.439 --> 01:43:10.646
We need you here.

974
01:43:11.776 --> 01:43:13.650
Why have you come?

975
01:43:15.321 --> 01:43:17.278
Do you not know?

976
01:43:26.582 --> 01:43:29.583
It is but a shadow and a thought that you love.

977
01:43:33.505 --> 01:43:35.914
I cannot give you what you seek.

978
01:43:49.438 --> 01:43:53.352
I have wished you joy since first I saw you.

979
01:44:12.502 --> 01:44:14.790
Just where do you think you're off to?

980
01:44:14.962 --> 01:44:16.291
Not this time.

981
01:44:16.464 --> 01:44:18.670
This time you must stay, Gimli.

982
01:44:21.386 --> 01:44:24.220
Have you learned nothing of
the stubbornness of Dwarves?

983
01:44:24.389 --> 01:44:28.053
You might as well accept it.
We're going with you, laddie.

984
01:44:50.372 --> 01:44:52.530
- What's happening?
- Where is he going?

985
01:44:52.874 --> 01:44:54.748
Where's he going?

986
01:44:57.337 --> 01:44:59.376
I don't understand.

987
01:45:03.802 --> 01:45:05.593
Lord Aragorn!

988
01:45:06.012 --> 01:45:08.716
Why does he leave on the eve of battle?

989
01:45:09.933 --> 01:45:12.009
He leaves because there is no hope.

990
01:45:12.685 --> 01:45:14.808
He leaves because he must.

991
01:45:14.978 --> 01:45:16.687
Too few have come.

992
01:45:16.856 --> 01:45:19.014
We cannot defeat the armies of Mordor.

993
01:45:21.527 --> 01:45:23.187
No...

994
01:45:23.612 --> 01:45:24.857
we cannot.

995
01:45:27.741 --> 01:45:31.525
But we will meet them in battle nonetheless.

996
01:45:45.967 --> 01:45:47.711
I have left instruction.

997
01:45:50.388 --> 01:45:53.638
The people are to follow your rule in my stead.

998
01:46:00.231 --> 01:46:02.473
Take up my seat in the Golden Hall.

999
01:46:03.735 --> 01:46:06.570
Long may you defend Edoras...

1000
01:46:06.738 --> 01:46:09.063
if the battle goes ill.

1001
01:46:10.157 --> 01:46:13.573
What other duty would you have me do, my lord?

1002
01:46:15.788 --> 01:46:17.745
Duty?

1003
01:46:19.917 --> 01:46:21.245
No.

1004
01:46:29.551 --> 01:46:31.674
I would have you smile again...

1005
01:46:35.098 --> 01:46:40.093
not grieve for those whose time has come.

1006
01:46:44.941 --> 01:46:48.440
You shall live to see these days renewed...

1007
01:46:52.782 --> 01:46:55.533
and no more despair.

1008
01:47:01.749 --> 01:47:05.449
What kind of army would linger in such a place?

1009
01:47:05.628 --> 01:47:07.455
One that is cursed.

1010
01:47:09.424 --> 01:47:11.961
Long ago, the Men of the Mountains swore an oath...

1011
01:47:12.384 --> 01:47:15.136
to the last king of Gondor...

1012
01:47:15.721 --> 01:47:17.298
to come to his aid...

1013
01:47:17.472 --> 01:47:19.180
to fight.

1014
01:47:19.683 --> 01:47:21.841
But when the time came...

1015
01:47:22.478 --> 01:47:25.098
when Gondor's need was dire...

1016
01:47:25.271 --> 01:47:27.145
they fled...

1017
01:47:27.315 --> 01:47:30.685
vanishing into the darkness of the mountain.

1018
01:47:31.736 --> 01:47:34.061
And so Isildur cursed them...

1019
01:47:35.615 --> 01:47:39.482
never to rest until they had fulfilled their pledge.

1020
01:47:43.790 --> 01:47:46.956
Who shall call them from the grey twilight?

1021
01:47:47.418 --> 01:47:49.660
The forgotten people.

1022
01:47:49.837 --> 01:47:52.328
The heir of him to whom the oath they swore.

1023
01:47:52.799 --> 01:47:54.672
From the north shall he come.

1024
01:47:55.176 --> 01:47:56.835
Need shall drive him.

1025
01:47:57.929 --> 01:48:01.427
He shall pass the door to the Paths of the Dead.

1026
01:48:19.908 --> 01:48:23.194
The very warmth of my blood seems stolen away.

1027
01:48:28.750 --> 01:48:30.707
The way is shut.

1028
01:48:31.461 --> 01:48:33.418
It was made by those who are dead.

1029
01:48:34.046 --> 01:48:36.288
And the Dead keep it.

1030
01:48:36.841 --> 01:48:38.383
The way is shut.

1031
01:48:49.729 --> 01:48:51.223
Brego!

1032
01:48:54.734 --> 01:48:57.438
I do not fear death.

1033
01:49:09.748 --> 01:49:12.156
Well, this is a thing unheard-of.

1034
01:49:12.334 --> 01:49:16.996
An Elf will go underground where a Dwarf dare not?

1035
01:49:17.172 --> 01:49:18.500
Oh.

1036
01:49:18.673 --> 01:49:21.508
Oh, I'd never hear the end of it.

1037
01:49:36.524 --> 01:49:38.766
We must ride light and swift.

1038
01:49:38.943 --> 01:49:40.686
It is a long road ahead.

1039
01:49:40.861 --> 01:49:43.946
And man and beast must reach the
end with the strength to fight.

1040
01:49:49.453 --> 01:49:52.454
Little Hobbits do not belong in war, Master Meriadoc.

1041
01:49:52.789 --> 01:49:54.782
All my friends have gone to battle.

1042
01:49:54.958 --> 01:49:56.832
I would be ashamed to be left behind.

1043
01:49:57.002 --> 01:49:59.125
It is a three-day gallop to Minas Tirith.

1044
01:49:59.296 --> 01:50:01.668
And none of my riders can bear you as a burden.

1045
01:50:02.674 --> 01:50:04.797
I want to fight.

1046
01:50:05.302 --> 01:50:07.294
I will say no more.

1047
01:50:24.112 --> 01:50:26.069
Ride with me.

1048
01:50:27.532 --> 01:50:28.942
My lady.

1049
01:50:29.116 --> 01:50:31.488
Form up! Move out!

1050
01:50:31.661 --> 01:50:34.864
Form up! Move out!

1051
01:50:37.958 --> 01:50:39.156
Ride!

1052
01:50:39.335 --> 01:50:42.289
Ride now to Gondor!

1053
01:51:23.920 --> 01:51:25.663
What is it?

1054
01:51:25.838 --> 01:51:27.380
What do you see?

1055
01:51:27.631 --> 01:51:29.754
I see shapes of men.

1056
01:51:32.428 --> 01:51:33.803
And of horses.

1057
01:51:34.555 --> 01:51:35.753
Where?

1058
01:51:35.931 --> 01:51:38.885
Pale banners like shreds of cloud.

1059
01:51:41.312 --> 01:51:43.517
Spears rise...

1060
01:51:44.147 --> 01:51:47.599
like winter-thickets through a shroud of mist.

1061
01:51:48.860 --> 01:51:51.018
The Dead are following.

1062
01:51:52.239 --> 01:51:53.733
They have been summoned.

1063
01:51:54.408 --> 01:51:56.234
The Dead?

1064
01:51:56.618 --> 01:51:58.326
Summoned?

1065
01:51:58.745 --> 01:52:00.619
I knew that.

1066
01:52:03.958 --> 01:52:05.702
Very good.

1067
01:52:06.419 --> 01:52:08.495
Very good! Legolas!

1068
01:52:46.458 --> 01:52:47.868
Do not look down.

1069
01:53:40.469 --> 01:53:45.594
Who enters my domain?

1070
01:53:49.353 --> 01:53:51.558
One who will have your allegiance.

1071
01:53:54.523 --> 01:53:59.862
The Dead do not suffer the living to pass.

1072
01:54:00.196 --> 01:54:02.865
You will suffer me.

1073
01:54:26.387 --> 01:54:29.757
The way is shut.

1074
01:54:30.934 --> 01:54:35.394
It was made by those who are dead.

1075
01:54:35.772 --> 01:54:39.935
And the Dead keep it.

1076
01:54:49.076 --> 01:54:52.161
The way is shut.

1077
01:54:53.915 --> 01:54:56.536
Now you must die.

1078
01:55:00.421 --> 01:55:03.256
I summon you to fulfill your oath.

1079
01:55:03.591 --> 01:55:08.548
None but the king of Gondor may command me.

1080
01:55:14.143 --> 01:55:16.300
That line was broken.

1081
01:55:18.939 --> 01:55:21.145
It has been remade.

1082
01:55:29.073 --> 01:55:30.616
Fight for us...

1083
01:55:30.784 --> 01:55:33.322
and regain your honor.

1084
01:55:37.498 --> 01:55:38.827
What say you?

1085
01:55:51.053 --> 01:55:52.595
What say you?

1086
01:55:53.347 --> 01:55:55.139
You waste your time, Aragorn.

1087
01:55:55.308 --> 01:55:58.474
They had no honor in life, they have none now in death.

1088
01:55:58.978 --> 01:56:01.469
I am Isildur's heir.

1089
01:56:02.023 --> 01:56:03.979
Fight for me...

1090
01:56:04.566 --> 01:56:08.149
and I will hold your oaths fulfilled.

1091
01:56:12.074 --> 01:56:14.031
What say you?

1092
01:56:21.958 --> 01:56:24.165
You have my word!

1093
01:56:24.460 --> 01:56:28.459
Fight, and I will release you from this living death!

1094
01:56:29.925 --> 01:56:31.419
What say you?!

1095
01:56:34.721 --> 01:56:37.675
Stand, you traitors!

1096
01:57:04.624 --> 01:57:05.656
Out!

1097
01:57:27.021 --> 01:57:28.599
Legolas!

1098
01:57:29.733 --> 01:57:30.930
Run!

1099
01:58:37.256 --> 01:58:39.331
We fight.

1100
01:58:49.685 --> 01:58:52.258
Open the gate! Quick!

1101
01:59:23.301 --> 01:59:25.293
Quick! Hurry!

1102
01:59:39.065 --> 01:59:40.690
Faramir!

1103
01:59:41.694 --> 01:59:44.943
Say not that he has fallen.

1104
01:59:46.115 --> 01:59:47.657
They were outnumbered.

1105
01:59:48.074 --> 01:59:49.652
None survived.

1106
01:59:50.368 --> 01:59:52.361
Fear.

1107
01:59:52.913 --> 01:59:56.116
The city is rank with it.

1108
01:59:58.460 --> 02:00:00.915
Let us ease their pain.

1109
02:00:01.171 --> 02:00:02.914
Release the prisoners.

1110
02:00:03.089 --> 02:00:05.047
Catapults!

1111
02:00:18.395 --> 02:00:21.847
My sons are spent.

1112
02:00:22.900 --> 02:00:25.817
My line has ended.

1113
02:00:28.656 --> 02:00:30.067
He's alive!

1114
02:00:30.240 --> 02:00:33.407
The House of Stewards has failed.

1115
02:00:33.577 --> 02:00:35.035
He needs medicine, my lord.

1116
02:00:36.080 --> 02:00:38.748
My line has ended!

1117
02:00:40.250 --> 02:00:42.243
My lord!

1118
02:00:55.766 --> 02:00:57.592
Rohan...

1119
02:00:58.351 --> 02:01:00.758
has deserted us.

1120
02:01:15.200 --> 02:01:18.403
Theoden's betrayed me.

1121
02:01:29.548 --> 02:01:31.375
Abandon your posts!

1122
02:01:32.426 --> 02:01:36.340
Flee! Flee for your lives!

1123
02:01:46.481 --> 02:01:48.023
Prepare for battle!

1124
02:01:48.566 --> 02:01:51.732
Hurry, men! To the wall! Defend the wall!

1125
02:01:52.904 --> 02:01:54.861
Over here!

1126
02:01:55.615 --> 02:01:57.987
Return to your posts!

1127
02:02:08.794 --> 02:02:11.415
Send these foul beasts into the abyss.

1128
02:02:21.598 --> 02:02:23.057
Stay where you are.

1129
02:02:40.032 --> 02:02:41.443
We need more rubble!

1130
02:02:41.617 --> 02:02:43.491
Watch out!

1131
02:02:43.661 --> 02:02:46.199
Down to the lower levels. Quick!

1132
02:02:48.082 --> 02:02:49.624
Double up, men!

1133
02:03:58.609 --> 02:04:01.610
Hold them back! Do not give in to fear.

1134
02:04:02.113 --> 02:04:05.611
Stand to your posts! Fight!

1135
02:04:46.280 --> 02:04:47.904
Not at the towers!

1136
02:04:48.073 --> 02:04:51.074
Aim for the trolls! Kill the trolls!

1137
02:04:51.827 --> 02:04:53.654
Bring them down!

1138
02:05:28.779 --> 02:05:30.819
Fight them back!

1139
02:05:30.990 --> 02:05:32.983
Peregrin Took!

1140
02:05:33.868 --> 02:05:37.034
- Go back to the Citadel!
- They'd called us out to fight.

1141
02:05:52.720 --> 02:05:55.092
This is no place for a Hobbit.

1142
02:06:20.830 --> 02:06:22.289
Guard of the Citadel, indeed.

1143
02:06:22.916 --> 02:06:26.249
Now, back, up the hill. Quickly. Quick!

1144
02:06:37.596 --> 02:06:40.550
What are you doing, you useless scum?!

1145
02:06:40.724 --> 02:06:42.682
The door won't give. It's too strong.

1146
02:06:49.024 --> 02:06:51.431
Get back there and smash it down.

1147
02:06:51.609 --> 02:06:53.602
But nothing can breach it.

1148
02:06:56.531 --> 02:06:58.773
Grond will breach it.

1149
02:07:02.203 --> 02:07:04.279
Bring up the wolf's head.

1150
02:07:07.458 --> 02:07:12.797
Grond! Grond! Grond! Grond!

1151
02:07:13.131 --> 02:07:16.963
Grond! Grond! Grond!

1152
02:07:18.886 --> 02:07:22.302
Grond! Grond! Grond!

1153
02:07:23.015 --> 02:07:26.680
Grond! Grond! Grond!

1154
02:07:27.102 --> 02:07:31.266
Grond! Grond! Grond!

1155
02:07:31.440 --> 02:07:35.141
Grond! Grond! Grond!

1156
02:07:49.200 --> 02:07:50.973
You may go no further.

1157
02:07:54.413 --> 02:07:56.916
You will not enter Gondor.

1158
02:07:57.541 --> 02:07:59.961
Who are you to deny us passage?

1159
02:08:00.044 --> 02:08:04.006
Legolas, fire a warning shot past the bosun's ear.

1160
02:08:05.779 --> 02:08:07.343
Mind your aim.

1161
02:08:14.078 --> 02:08:16.623
That's it. Right. We warned you.

1162
02:08:16.831 --> 02:08:18.812
Prepare to be boarded.

1163
02:08:20.585 --> 02:08:21.721
Boarded?

1164
02:08:21.732 --> 02:08:23.713
By you and whose army?

1165
02:08:25.173 --> 02:08:26.945
This army.

1166
02:08:44.150 --> 02:08:45.609
In there.

1167
02:08:47.695 --> 02:08:49.415
What is this place?

1168
02:08:53.951 --> 02:08:57.235
Master must go inside the tunnel.

1169
02:08:58.904 --> 02:09:02.397
Now that I'm here, I don't think I want to.

1170
02:09:05.055 --> 02:09:06.776
It's the only way.

1171
02:09:09.383 --> 02:09:11.155
Go in...

1172
02:09:11.635 --> 02:09:13.841
or go back.

1173
02:09:16.681 --> 02:09:19.302
I can't go back.

1174
02:09:32.113 --> 02:09:34.657
- What's that smell?
- Orcses' filth.

1175
02:09:34.668 --> 02:09:37.615
Orcses come in here sometimes.

1176
02:09:43.218 --> 02:09:44.469
Hurry.

1177
02:09:49.734 --> 02:09:51.298
This way.

1178
02:09:54.322 --> 02:09:55.938
Smeagol?

1179
02:09:57.085 --> 02:09:59.066
Over here.

1180
02:10:08.190 --> 02:10:10.536
It's sticky. What is it?

1181
02:10:11.318 --> 02:10:13.038
You will see.

1182
02:10:13.612 --> 02:10:15.489
Oh, yes.

1183
02:10:15.958 --> 02:10:18.822
You will see.

1184
02:10:28.105 --> 02:10:29.669
Smeagol?

1185
02:10:31.442 --> 02:10:32.467
Smeagol!

1186
02:10:35.091 --> 02:10:36.760
Smeagol!

1187
02:10:46.352 --> 02:10:47.809
Sam.

1188
02:12:28.275 --> 02:12:30.590
And you, Frodo Baggins...

1189
02:12:30.600 --> 02:12:35.536
I give you the light of
Earendil, our most beloved star.

1190
02:12:36.773 --> 02:12:39.995
May it be a light for you in dark places...

1191
02:12:40.036 --> 02:12:43.628
when all other lights go out.

1192
02:12:43.654 --> 02:12:47.512
Aiya Earendil Elenion Ancalima!
(Hail Earendil brightest of the Stars!)

1193
02:14:00.135 --> 02:14:02.952
Naughty little fly.

1194
02:14:03.576 --> 02:14:06.913
Why does he cry?

1195
02:14:07.330 --> 02:14:10.510
Caught in a web

1196
02:14:10.927 --> 02:14:13.137
Soon you'll be...

1197
02:14:13.513 --> 02:14:15.340
Eaten.

1198
02:14:53.469 --> 02:14:55.387
Got away, did it, precious?

1199
02:14:55.815 --> 02:14:57.587
Not this time.

1200
02:14:57.796 --> 02:15:00.765
- Not this time!
- No!

1201
02:15:08.066 --> 02:15:10.941
It wasn't us. It wasn't us!

1202
02:15:11.872 --> 02:15:14.427
Smeagol wouldn't hurt master.

1203
02:15:14.583 --> 02:15:16.106
We promised.

1204
02:15:16.564 --> 02:15:19.014
You must believe us.

1205
02:15:19.119 --> 02:15:20.660
It was the precious.

1206
02:15:21.465 --> 02:15:25.621
The precious made us do it.

1207
02:15:43.048 --> 02:15:45.643
I have to destroy it, Smeagol.

1208
02:15:55.091 --> 02:15:57.987
I have to destroy it for both our sakes.

1209
02:16:08.438 --> 02:16:09.495
No!

1210
02:16:33.045 --> 02:16:35.140
I'm so sorry, Sam.

1211
02:16:40.031 --> 02:16:42.187
I'm so sorry.

1212
02:17:08.496 --> 02:17:12.761
This task was appointed to you, Frodo of the Shire.

1213
02:17:14.283 --> 02:17:16.421
If you do not find a way...

1214
02:17:17.933 --> 02:17:19.549
no one will.

1215
02:17:53.280 --> 02:17:55.395
The scouts report Minas Tirith is surrounded.

1216
02:17:55.886 --> 02:17:57.852
The lower level's in flames.

1217
02:17:58.597 --> 02:18:00.771
Everywhere, legions of the enemy advance.

1218
02:18:01.569 --> 02:18:02.768
Time is against us.

1219
02:18:02.820 --> 02:18:04.065
Make ready!

1220
02:18:04.332 --> 02:18:06.065
Take heart, Merry.

1221
02:18:06.418 --> 02:18:08.451
It will soon be over.

1222
02:18:09.514 --> 02:18:10.745
My lady...

1223
02:18:11.495 --> 02:18:13.873
you are fair and brave...

1224
02:18:14.394 --> 02:18:16.636
and have much to live for...

1225
02:18:18.252 --> 02:18:20.284
and many who love you.

1226
02:18:23.466 --> 02:18:25.800
I know it is too late to turn aside.

1227
02:18:26.959 --> 02:18:29.546
I know there is not much point now in hoping.

1228
02:18:30.921 --> 02:18:34.518
If I were a knight of Rohan, capable of great deeds...

1229
02:18:34.519 --> 02:18:37.471
But
- I'm not.

1230
02:18:37.907 --> 02:18:39.481
I'm a Hobbit.

1231
02:18:42.630 --> 02:18:44.695
And I know I can't save Middle-earth.

1232
02:18:48.490 --> 02:18:50.398
I just want to help my friends.

1233
02:18:52.817 --> 02:18:53.988
Frodo.

1234
02:18:55.320 --> 02:18:56.579
Sam.

1235
02:18:58.656 --> 02:19:00.206
Pippin.

1236
02:19:01.993 --> 02:19:05.225
More than anything, I wish I could see them again.

1237
02:19:09.187 --> 02:19:11.252
Prepare to move out!

1238
02:19:11.627 --> 02:19:14.870
Make haste. We ride through the night.

1239
02:19:31.292 --> 02:19:32.283
To battle.

1240
02:19:32.960 --> 02:19:34.264
To battle.

1241
02:19:57.568 --> 02:19:58.932
Back to the gate!

1242
02:19:59.653 --> 02:20:01.384
Hurry!

1243
02:20:21.550 --> 02:20:25.785
I am steward of the House of Anarion.

1244
02:20:26.242 --> 02:20:28.431
Thus have I walked.

1245
02:20:29.891 --> 02:20:32.811
And thus now will I sleep.

1246
02:20:39.015 --> 02:20:40.804
Gondor is lost.

1247
02:20:41.517 --> 02:20:44.718
There is no hope for Men.

1248
02:20:59.868 --> 02:21:02.161
Why do the fools fly?

1249
02:21:04.091 --> 02:21:06.790
Better to die sooner than late.

1250
02:21:09.252 --> 02:21:10.995
For die we must.

1251
02:21:23.642 --> 02:21:26.978
No tomb for Denethor and Faramir.

1252
02:21:27.812 --> 02:21:33.339
No long, slow sleep of death embalmed.

1253
02:21:34.016 --> 02:21:38.645
We shall burn, like the heathen kings of old.

1254
02:21:42.775 --> 02:21:44.153
Bring wood and oil.

1255
02:21:47.415 --> 02:21:48.325
Steady.

1256
02:21:49.031 --> 02:21:50.539
Steady.

1257
02:22:05.401 --> 02:22:07.695
You are soldiers of Gondor.

1258
02:22:08.216 --> 02:22:12.543
No matter what comes through that
gate, you will stand your ground.

1259
02:22:18.820 --> 02:22:19.821
Run!

1260
02:22:22.240 --> 02:22:23.544
Volley!

1261
02:22:24.451 --> 02:22:25.866
Fire!

1262
02:24:19.543 --> 02:24:21.263
Let him go, you filth.

1263
02:24:23.317 --> 02:24:24.704
Let him go!

1264
02:24:26.320 --> 02:24:28.405
You will not touch him again.

1265
02:24:31.690 --> 02:24:33.150
Come on and finish it.

1266
02:26:23.309 --> 02:26:24.433
Back!

1267
02:26:35.665 --> 02:26:36.812
Mr. Frodo.

1268
02:26:46.613 --> 02:26:48.074
Oh, no.

1269
02:26:48.699 --> 02:26:50.207
Frodo.

1270
02:26:50.836 --> 02:26:52.376
Mr. Frodo.

1271
02:26:57.322 --> 02:26:58.448
Wake up.

1272
02:27:02.566 --> 02:27:04.704
Don't leave me here alone.

1273
02:27:06.529 --> 02:27:08.666
Don't go where I can't follow.

1274
02:27:13.098 --> 02:27:14.245
Wake up.

1275
02:27:21.178 --> 02:27:23.107
Not asleep.

1276
02:27:25.453 --> 02:27:27.174
Dead.

1277
02:27:46.099 --> 02:27:47.975
You get back, you scum!

1278
02:27:57.412 --> 02:27:58.976
What's this?

1279
02:27:59.831 --> 02:28:02.729
Looks like old Shelob's been having a bit of fun.

1280
02:28:04.554 --> 02:28:06.900
Killed another one, has she?

1281
02:28:07.213 --> 02:28:09.038
No.

1282
02:28:11.957 --> 02:28:14.058
This fellow ain't dead.

1283
02:28:14.063 --> 02:28:16.232
Not dead?

1284
02:28:16.753 --> 02:28:22.175
- She jabs him with her stinger,
and he goes as limp as a boned fish.

1285
02:28:22.853 --> 02:28:25.460
Then she has her way with them.

1286
02:28:26.033 --> 02:28:28.067
That's how she likes to feed.

1287
02:28:28.223 --> 02:28:30.152
Fresh blood.

1288
02:28:30.361 --> 02:28:32.550
Get him to the tower!

1289
02:28:36.252 --> 02:28:38.003
Samwise, you fool.

1290
02:28:38.045 --> 02:28:40.892
This scum will be awake in a couple of hours.

1291
02:28:41.204 --> 02:28:43.446
Then he'll wish he'd never been born.

1292
02:29:07.949 --> 02:29:10.973
The house of his spirit crumbles.

1293
02:29:12.329 --> 02:29:13.580
He is burning.

1294
02:29:14.883 --> 02:29:16.239
Already burning.

1295
02:29:16.604 --> 02:29:18.168
He's not dead.

1296
02:29:18.950 --> 02:29:20.514
He's not dead!

1297
02:29:22.599 --> 02:29:24.276
No! No!

1298
02:29:24.789 --> 02:29:26.770
No! No!

1299
02:29:27.239 --> 02:29:29.220
He's not dead!

1300
02:29:29.741 --> 02:29:33.026
- Farewell, Peregrin, son of Paladin.
- No! No! No!

1301
02:29:33.234 --> 02:29:36.363
I release you from my service.

1302
02:29:37.718 --> 02:29:42.045
Go now and die in what way seems best to you.

1303
02:29:44.402 --> 02:29:46.456
Pour oil on the wood!

1304
02:29:48.353 --> 02:29:50.216
Come on, soldier! Move it!

1305
02:29:50.960 --> 02:29:53.638
- Hurry along there! Hurry along!
- Gandalf!

1306
02:29:54.297 --> 02:29:55.548
Where is Gandalf?

1307
02:29:57.008 --> 02:29:58.050
Gandalf!

1308
02:30:03.837 --> 02:30:04.880
Retreat!

1309
02:30:07.070 --> 02:30:08.790
The city is breached!

1310
02:30:08.946 --> 02:30:11.866
Fall back! To the second level!

1311
02:30:15.724 --> 02:30:17.496
Get the women and children out!

1312
02:30:17.601 --> 02:30:19.269
Get them out!

1313
02:30:19.540 --> 02:30:20.885
Retreat!

1314
02:30:20.989 --> 02:30:22.971
Come on. Come on, move.

1315
02:30:23.179 --> 02:30:27.506
Move into the city. Kill all in your path.

1316
02:30:35.587 --> 02:30:37.829
Take them down!

1317
02:30:58.630 --> 02:31:01.446
Fight! Fight to the last man!

1318
02:31:01.602 --> 02:31:03.114
Fight for your lives!

1319
02:31:03.524 --> 02:31:04.457
Gandalf!

1320
02:31:08.713 --> 02:31:09.891
Gandalf!

1321
02:31:09.996 --> 02:31:12.655
Denethor has lost his mind!

1322
02:31:12.863 --> 02:31:15.053
He's burning Faramir alive!

1323
02:31:15.094 --> 02:31:17.034
Up! Quickly!

1324
02:31:24.124 --> 02:31:25.323
Go back to the abyss.

1325
02:31:27.148 --> 02:31:30.484
Fall into the nothingness that
awaits you and your master.

1326
02:31:30.837 --> 02:31:37.158
Do you not know death when you see it, old man?

1327
02:31:37.366 --> 02:31:41.402
This is my hour.

1328
02:31:51.651 --> 02:31:52.641
Gandalf!

1329
02:32:01.890 --> 02:32:05.102
You have failed.

1330
02:32:06.165 --> 02:32:11.045
The world of Men will fall.

1331
02:33:08.236 --> 02:33:09.330
Courage, Merry.

1332
02:33:09.904 --> 02:33:11.990
Courage for our friends.

1333
02:33:15.817 --> 02:33:18.945
Form ranks, you maggots. Form ranks!

1334
02:33:18.976 --> 02:33:22.156
Pikes in front. Archers behind.

1335
02:33:30.393 --> 02:33:33.573
Eomer, take your Eored down the left flank.

1336
02:33:33.813 --> 02:33:34.877
Flank ready.

1337
02:33:35.346 --> 02:33:37.796
Gamling, follow the king's banner down the center.

1338
02:33:37.953 --> 02:33:41.759
Grimbold, take your company
right after you pass the wall.

1339
02:33:42.071 --> 02:33:44.470
Forth, and fear no darkness!

1340
02:33:44.887 --> 02:33:48.536
Arise, arise, Riders of Theoden!

1341
02:33:48.911 --> 02:33:54.062
Spears shall be shaken...
Shields shall be splintered...

1342
02:33:54.375 --> 02:33:57.868
a sword-day, a red day...

1343
02:33:58.191 --> 02:34:01.545
and the sun rises!

1344
02:34:09.598 --> 02:34:14.082
Whatever happens, stay with me. I'll look after you.

1345
02:34:20.286 --> 02:34:22.319
Ride now!

1346
02:34:23.831 --> 02:34:25.693
Ride now!

1347
02:34:26.542 --> 02:34:29.357
Ride! Ride for ruin...

1348
02:34:29.566 --> 02:34:32.746
and the world's ending!

1349
02:34:34.153 --> 02:34:38.064
- Death!
- Death!

1350
02:34:39.158 --> 02:34:42.234
- Death!
- Death!

1351
02:34:43.006 --> 02:34:44.841
- Death!
- Death!

1352
02:34:45.258 --> 02:34:49.533
- Death!
- Death!

1353
02:34:53.652 --> 02:34:56.154
For Eorlingas!

1354
02:35:39.269 --> 02:35:40.573
Fire!

1355
02:35:44.795 --> 02:35:46.620
Death!

1356
02:35:50.165 --> 02:35:51.886
Charge!

1357
02:35:51.938 --> 02:35:53.025
Fire at will!

1358
02:36:51.006 --> 02:36:53.873
Set a fire in our flesh.

1359
02:37:11.776 --> 02:37:13.424
Stay this madness!

1360
02:37:17.845 --> 02:37:22.182
You may triumph in the field of battle for a day...

1361
02:37:22.818 --> 02:37:26.353
but against the power that has risen in the east...

1362
02:37:26.718 --> 02:37:29.585
there is no victory.

1363
02:37:59.145 --> 02:38:00.814
No!

1364
02:38:00.876 --> 02:38:03.733
You will not take my son from me!

1365
02:38:03.764 --> 02:38:05.871
No!

1366
02:38:17.080 --> 02:38:18.487
Faramir.

1367
02:38:32.303 --> 02:38:36.004
So passes Denethor, son of Ecthelion.

1368
02:39:03.948 --> 02:39:06.034
Drive them to the river!

1369
02:39:08.380 --> 02:39:10.674
Make safe the city!

1370
02:39:50.452 --> 02:39:52.172
Re-form the line!

1371
02:39:53.372 --> 02:39:55.248
Re-form the line!

1372
02:40:02.443 --> 02:40:05.206
Sound the charge! Take them head-on!

1373
02:40:05.675 --> 02:40:07.865
Charge!

1374
02:41:26.692 --> 02:41:27.943
Cut him down!

1375
02:41:54.949 --> 02:41:57.399
Take the reins. Pull him left!

1376
02:41:59.797 --> 02:42:00.892
Left!

1377
02:42:18.670 --> 02:42:20.130
Aim for their heads!

1378
02:42:26.177 --> 02:42:29.514
Bring it down! Bring it down! Bring it down!

1379
02:42:35.196 --> 02:42:36.135
Merry!

1380
02:42:43.381 --> 02:42:44.789
Merry!

1381
02:43:58.246 --> 02:44:00.175
I didn't think it would end this way.

1382
02:44:01.531 --> 02:44:02.990
End?

1383
02:44:04.367 --> 02:44:06.588
No, the journey doesn't end here.

1384
02:44:08.871 --> 02:44:11.801
Death is just another path...

1385
02:44:12.667 --> 02:44:14.669
one that we all must take.

1386
02:44:15.638 --> 02:44:19.204
The grey rain curtain of this world rolls back...

1387
02:44:19.308 --> 02:44:22.749
and all turns to silver glass.

1388
02:44:25.043 --> 02:44:26.816
And then you see it.

1389
02:44:28.734 --> 02:44:31.247
What, Gandalf?

1390
02:44:32.415 --> 02:44:33.854
See what?

1391
02:44:34.975 --> 02:44:36.982
White shores...

1392
02:44:38.859 --> 02:44:41.101
and beyond.

1393
02:44:42.665 --> 02:44:44.541
A far green country...

1394
02:44:45.303 --> 02:44:48.034
under a swift sunrise.

1395
02:44:52.205 --> 02:44:53.926
Well...

1396
02:44:53.978 --> 02:44:55.542
that isn't so bad.

1397
02:44:55.563 --> 02:44:56.845
No.

1398
02:44:59.191 --> 02:45:00.807
No, it isn't.

1399
02:45:17.125 --> 02:45:20.514
Rally to me! To me!

1400
02:45:41.472 --> 02:45:45.851
Feast on his flesh.

1401
02:45:50.283 --> 02:45:52.420
I will kill you if you touch him.

1402
02:45:52.431 --> 02:45:57.947
Do not come between the Nazgul and his prey.

1403
02:47:06.920 --> 02:47:10.309
Late as usual, pirate scum!

1404
02:47:10.543 --> 02:47:12.342
There's knife-work here needs doing.

1405
02:47:12.394 --> 02:47:16.213
Come on, you sea rats! Get off your ships!

1406
02:47:31.345 --> 02:47:33.721
There's plenty for the both of us.

1407
02:47:33.821 --> 02:47:36.167
May the best Dwarf win.

1408
02:47:53.528 --> 02:47:55.755
You fool.

1409
02:47:55.926 --> 02:47:59.342
No man can kill me.

1410
02:48:01.713 --> 02:48:04.890
Die now.

1411
02:48:15.529 --> 02:48:17.563
I am no man.

1412
02:48:34.089 --> 02:48:37.588
- 15! 16!
- 17!

1413
02:48:45.391 --> 02:48:47.301
Merry!

1414
02:49:29.309 --> 02:49:31.101
Legolas!

1415
02:49:53.500 --> 02:49:55.872
33, 34.

1416
02:50:42.965 --> 02:50:45.337
That still only counts as one!

1417
02:50:45.467 --> 02:50:47.667
Come on, then. Come on!

1418
02:51:31.387 --> 02:51:34.222
I know your face...

1419
02:51:36.006 --> 02:51:37.927
Eowyn.

1420
02:51:40.521 --> 02:51:42.893
My eyes darken.

1421
02:51:43.983 --> 02:51:45.421
No.

1422
02:51:46.235 --> 02:51:47.924
No.

1423
02:51:49.931 --> 02:51:52.438
I am going to save you.

1424
02:51:53.763 --> 02:51:56.109
You already did.

1425
02:51:59.790 --> 02:52:01.414
Eowyn...

1426
02:52:02.866 --> 02:52:05.409
my body is broken.

1427
02:52:10.420 --> 02:52:12.922
You have to let me go.

1428
02:52:18.787 --> 02:52:21.382
I go to my fathers...

1429
02:52:22.833 --> 02:52:25.689
in whose mighty company...

1430
02:52:26.107 --> 02:52:29.482
I shall not now feel ashamed.

1431
02:52:46.054 --> 02:52:47.709
Eowyn.

1432
02:53:34.174 --> 02:53:36.671
Release us.

1433
02:53:38.527 --> 02:53:40.302
Bad idea.

1434
02:53:40.456 --> 02:53:44.183
Very handy in a tight spot, these
lads, despite the fact they're dead.

1435
02:53:44.209 --> 02:53:46.468
You gave us your word.

1436
02:53:48.145 --> 02:53:50.335
I hold your oath fulfilled.

1437
02:53:51.560 --> 02:53:53.019
Go.

1438
02:53:53.724 --> 02:53:55.561
Be at peace.

1439
02:54:38.862 --> 02:54:40.801
Merry.

1440
02:54:41.375 --> 02:54:44.711
No!

1441
02:54:48.256 --> 02:54:51.019
No!

1442
02:55:14.668 --> 02:55:18.598
With a sigh.

1443
02:55:18.713 --> 02:55:22.476
You turn away.

1444
02:55:22.613 --> 02:55:26.648
With a deepening heart.

1445
02:55:26.679 --> 02:55:31.580
No more words to say.

1446
02:55:31.705 --> 02:55:35.229
You will find.

1447
02:55:35.281 --> 02:55:43.779
That the world has changed forever.

1448
02:56:08.470 --> 02:56:16.280
And the trees are now turning from green to gold.

1449
02:56:20.148 --> 02:56:24.965
And the sun is now fading.

1450
02:56:25.070 --> 02:56:35.142
I wish I could hold you closer.

1451
02:56:37.973 --> 02:56:39.250
Merry!

1452
02:56:40.793 --> 02:56:42.900
Merry!

1453
02:56:54.244 --> 02:56:56.071
Merry.

1454
02:56:58.540 --> 02:56:59.785
Merry, it's me.

1455
02:57:02.398 --> 02:57:03.961
It's Pippin.

1456
02:57:06.464 --> 02:57:08.753
I knew you'd find me.

1457
02:57:08.925 --> 02:57:10.123
Yes.

1458
02:57:12.554 --> 02:57:14.630
Are you going to leave me?

1459
02:57:15.181 --> 02:57:16.889
No, Merry.

1460
02:57:18.184 --> 02:57:20.426
I'm going to look after you.

1461
02:58:04.125 --> 02:58:05.848
Hands off!

1462
02:58:06.002 --> 02:58:09.189
That shiny shirt, that's mine.

1463
02:58:09.442 --> 02:58:13.606
It's going to the Great Eye,
along with everything else.

1464
02:58:15.125 --> 02:58:19.035
I don't take orders from stinking Morgul-rats!

1465
02:58:19.817 --> 02:58:24.978
You touch it, and I'll stick this blade in your gut.

1466
02:58:45.467 --> 02:58:47.396
The scum tried to knife me.

1467
02:58:47.448 --> 02:58:49.390
Kill him!

1468
03:00:32.551 --> 03:00:34.617
That's for Frodo!

1469
03:00:34.897 --> 03:00:37.124
And for the Shire!

1470
03:00:40.528 --> 03:00:42.838
And that's for my old Gaffer!

1471
03:01:12.277 --> 03:01:15.663
Stop your squealing, you dunghill rat.

1472
03:01:16.761 --> 03:01:21.501
I'm gonna bleed you like a stuck pig.

1473
03:01:28.752 --> 03:01:30.506
Not if I stick you first.

1474
03:01:30.629 --> 03:01:32.193
Sam!

1475
03:01:37.250 --> 03:01:39.335
Oh, Sam, I'm so sorry.

1476
03:01:39.387 --> 03:01:41.520
Sorry for everything.

1477
03:01:41.733 --> 03:01:45.690
- Let's get you out of here.
- It's too late. It's over.

1478
03:01:45.800 --> 03:01:48.733
They've taken it. Sam...

1479
03:01:49.501 --> 03:01:51.027
they took the Ring.

1480
03:01:51.743 --> 03:01:54.489
Begging your pardon, but they haven't.

1481
03:02:06.445 --> 03:02:08.672
I thought I'd lost you.

1482
03:02:09.052 --> 03:02:10.759
So I took it.

1483
03:02:11.919 --> 03:02:14.005
Only for safekeeping.

1484
03:02:15.256 --> 03:02:17.009
Give it to me.

1485
03:02:20.521 --> 03:02:22.769
Give me the Ring, Sam.

1486
03:02:27.403 --> 03:02:28.689
Sam.

1487
03:02:30.270 --> 03:02:32.238
Give me the Ring.

1488
03:02:52.949 --> 03:02:54.250
You must understand.

1489
03:02:57.745 --> 03:02:59.593
The Ring is my burden.

1490
03:03:00.769 --> 03:03:02.927
It will destroy you, Sam.

1491
03:03:06.086 --> 03:03:08.064
Come on, Mr. Frodo.

1492
03:03:09.371 --> 03:03:11.027
We best find you some clothes.

1493
03:03:11.196 --> 03:03:14.232
You can't go walking through
Mordor in naught but your skin.

1494
03:03:35.970 --> 03:03:38.176
We did it, Mr. Frodo.

1495
03:03:38.681 --> 03:03:40.969
We made it to Mordor.

1496
03:03:42.309 --> 03:03:43.969
There are so many of them.

1497
03:03:44.937 --> 03:03:47.510
We'll never get through unseen.

1498
03:03:52.642 --> 03:03:55.986
It's him, the Eye.

1499
03:04:03.705 --> 03:04:06.327
We have to go in there, Mr. Frodo.

1500
03:04:06.792 --> 03:04:08.831
There's nothing for it.

1501
03:04:11.838 --> 03:04:16.251
Come on. Let's just make it down the hill for starters.

1502
03:04:25.435 --> 03:04:28.852
Frodo has passed beyond my sight.

1503
03:04:30.127 --> 03:04:32.994
The darkness is deepening.

1504
03:04:33.046 --> 03:04:35.340
If Sauron had the Ring, we would know it.

1505
03:04:35.351 --> 03:04:37.776
It's only a matter of time.

1506
03:04:39.250 --> 03:04:41.689
He has suffered a defeat, yes but...

1507
03:04:42.743 --> 03:04:47.227
behind the walls of Mordor, our enemy is regrouping.

1508
03:04:47.383 --> 03:04:49.156
Let him stay there.

1509
03:04:49.166 --> 03:04:52.044
Let him rot! Why should we care?

1510
03:04:52.107 --> 03:04:57.445
Because 10,000 Orcs now stand
between Frodo and Mount Doom.

1511
03:05:04.118 --> 03:05:06.672
I've sent him to his death.

1512
03:05:08.185 --> 03:05:09.507
No.

1513
03:05:10.010 --> 03:05:12.428
There is still hope for Frodo.

1514
03:05:12.773 --> 03:05:16.901
He needs time and safe passage
across the plains of Gorgoroth.

1515
03:05:17.986 --> 03:05:20.559
- We can give him that.
- How?

1516
03:05:20.906 --> 03:05:23.610
Draw out Sauron's armies.

1517
03:05:23.773 --> 03:05:25.906
Empty his lands.

1518
03:05:26.119 --> 03:05:29.203
Then we gather our full strength
and march on the Black Gate.

1519
03:05:29.768 --> 03:05:32.832
We cannot achieve victory through strength of arms.

1520
03:05:33.001 --> 03:05:34.578
Not for ourselves.

1521
03:05:34.773 --> 03:05:40.381
But we can give Frodo his chance if
we keep Sauron's Eye fixed upon us.

1522
03:05:42.176 --> 03:05:45.960
Keep him blind to all else that moves.

1523
03:05:46.712 --> 03:05:47.921
A diversion.

1524
03:05:48.068 --> 03:05:49.890
Certainty of death...

1525
03:05:49.997 --> 03:05:52.811
small chance of success...

1526
03:05:53.646 --> 03:05:55.265
what are we waiting for?

1527
03:05:55.836 --> 03:05:58.264
Sauron will suspect a trap.

1528
03:05:59.068 --> 03:06:01.107
He will not take the bait.

1529
03:06:02.613 --> 03:06:05.104
Oh, I think he will.

1530
03:06:39.420 --> 03:06:42.131
Long have you hunted me.

1531
03:06:42.339 --> 03:06:44.320
Long have I eluded you.

1532
03:06:45.937 --> 03:06:47.733
No more.

1533
03:06:49.378 --> 03:06:51.858
Behold the Sword of Elendil.

1534
03:07:36.350 --> 03:07:38.862
The city has fallen silent.

1535
03:07:40.521 --> 03:07:43.578
There is no warmth left in the sun.

1536
03:07:44.379 --> 03:07:46.087
It grows so cold.

1537
03:07:49.071 --> 03:07:52.128
It's just the damp of the first spring rain.

1538
03:07:58.508 --> 03:08:01.721
I do not believe this darkness will endure.

1539
03:08:30.309 --> 03:08:31.925
Look, the Orcs...

1540
03:08:32.395 --> 03:08:34.460
they're moving off.

1541
03:08:35.512 --> 03:08:37.588
You see, Mr. Frodo...

1542
03:08:37.765 --> 03:08:40.090
some luck at last.

1543
03:08:40.267 --> 03:08:42.094
Move it, you slugs!

1544
03:08:43.343 --> 03:08:46.764
Come on! Faster!

1545
03:08:54.656 --> 03:08:57.888
Come along, you coldhearted wretched scum...

1546
03:08:57.899 --> 03:09:02.448
I'll whip you down to the bone, you...

1547
03:09:05.292 --> 03:09:06.960
Come on!

1548
03:09:07.127 --> 03:09:09.338
What have I told you?

1549
03:09:09.358 --> 03:09:11.652
No evation...

1550
03:09:12.642 --> 03:09:14.467
Now move it!

1551
03:09:16.292 --> 03:09:17.796
Get up!

1552
03:09:18.169 --> 03:09:20.848
Come on, you slugs!

1553
03:09:20.984 --> 03:09:24.633
You two are going straight to the front line!

1554
03:09:24.811 --> 03:09:30.107
Now, move it! Go on! Fall
in! Move it! Move it! Move it!

1555
03:09:42.672 --> 03:09:46.478
To the Gate, you slugs! Now, move it!

1556
03:09:55.914 --> 03:09:59.507
Don't you know we're at war?

1557
03:10:21.825 --> 03:10:24.695
Company, halt!

1558
03:10:28.498 --> 03:10:31.908
Inspection!

1559
03:10:32.043 --> 03:10:34.540
Sam, help me.

1560
03:10:34.702 --> 03:10:36.539
Mr. Frodo!

1561
03:10:39.237 --> 03:10:41.796
Stand up, Mr. Frodo. Stand up!

1562
03:10:41.948 --> 03:10:43.796
It's so heavy.

1563
03:10:52.897 --> 03:10:54.101
Oh, no.

1564
03:10:59.726 --> 03:11:01.729
What do I do? What do we do?

1565
03:11:04.783 --> 03:11:05.946
- Hit me.
- What?

1566
03:11:06.087 --> 03:11:08.157
Hit me, Sam. Start fighting.

1567
03:11:08.328 --> 03:11:09.906
Get off of me!

1568
03:11:10.570 --> 03:11:12.906
Nobody pushes me, you filthy maggot.

1569
03:11:21.518 --> 03:11:23.589
Get off of me!

1570
03:11:24.490 --> 03:11:26.420
Break it up! Break it up!

1571
03:11:28.974 --> 03:11:33.594
Oi! I'll have your guts if you
don't shut this rabble down!

1572
03:11:33.614 --> 03:11:36.053
Go, Sam. Now!

1573
03:11:44.979 --> 03:11:46.531
Move along, scum!

1574
03:11:46.699 --> 03:11:48.608
Back in the line!

1575
03:11:49.097 --> 03:11:50.910
You maggots!

1576
03:11:51.548 --> 03:11:54.580
Get back into the line, you slugs!

1577
03:11:56.918 --> 03:12:00.452
Dig it, you slugs. Move it.

1578
03:12:49.156 --> 03:12:51.300
I can't...

1579
03:12:51.450 --> 03:12:55.219
I can't... I can't manage the Ring, Sam.

1580
03:12:55.308 --> 03:12:56.548
It's... It's...

1581
03:12:56.716 --> 03:12:59.299
It's such a weight to carry.

1582
03:13:00.156 --> 03:13:01.219
It's...

1583
03:13:01.356 --> 03:13:03.354
Such a weight.

1584
03:13:08.289 --> 03:13:10.792
We're going that way. Straight as we can.

1585
03:13:12.147 --> 03:13:15.380
There's no point carrying
anything we're not sure to need.

1586
03:13:30.446 --> 03:13:32.377
Mr. Frodo.

1587
03:13:33.835 --> 03:13:35.381
Look.

1588
03:13:37.850 --> 03:13:39.801
There is light...

1589
03:13:40.143 --> 03:13:41.707
and beauty up there...

1590
03:13:41.968 --> 03:13:44.437
that no shadow can touch.

1591
03:14:35.458 --> 03:14:37.114
Take mine.

1592
03:14:37.595 --> 03:14:39.739
There's a few drops left.

1593
03:14:54.904 --> 03:14:57.540
There will be none left for the return journey.

1594
03:14:58.449 --> 03:15:01.637
I don't think there will be
a return journey, Mr. Frodo.

1595
03:15:54.493 --> 03:15:56.683
Frodo, get down!

1596
03:15:58.403 --> 03:16:00.354
Hide!

1597
03:16:10.499 --> 03:16:12.538
Frodo!

1598
03:16:18.319 --> 03:16:19.792
Where are they?

1599
03:16:55.855 --> 03:16:58.913
Let the Lord of the Black Land come forth!

1600
03:16:59.818 --> 03:17:02.674
Let justice be done upon him!

1601
03:17:46.113 --> 03:17:50.125
My master, Sauron the Great, bids thee welcome.

1602
03:17:55.966 --> 03:17:59.677
Is there any in this rout with
authority to treat with me?

1603
03:18:00.033 --> 03:18:03.184
We do not come to treat with Sauron...

1604
03:18:03.317 --> 03:18:05.872
faithless and accursed.

1605
03:18:05.882 --> 03:18:09.886
Tell your master this: The
armies of Mordor must disband.

1606
03:18:09.990 --> 03:18:12.806
He is to depart these lands, never to return.

1607
03:18:13.744 --> 03:18:16.324
Old Greybeard.

1608
03:18:17.654 --> 03:18:22.042
I have a token I was bidden to show thee.

1609
03:18:27.049 --> 03:18:28.377
Frodo.

1610
03:18:31.219 --> 03:18:32.678
Frodo.

1611
03:18:33.399 --> 03:18:34.878
- Silence.
- No!

1612
03:18:35.484 --> 03:18:37.052
Silence!

1613
03:18:38.821 --> 03:18:42.600
The Halfling was dear to thee, I see.

1614
03:18:43.513 --> 03:18:47.687
Know that he suffered greatly at the hands of his host.

1615
03:18:53.053 --> 03:18:58.953
Who would've thought one so
small could endure so much pain?

1616
03:19:01.551 --> 03:19:03.705
And he did, Gandalf.

1617
03:19:03.845 --> 03:19:05.620
He did.

1618
03:19:12.552 --> 03:19:14.129
And who is this?

1619
03:19:14.220 --> 03:19:16.379
Isildur's heir?

1620
03:19:16.514 --> 03:19:19.556
It takes more to make a king
than a broken Elvish blade.

1621
03:19:24.282 --> 03:19:26.886
I guess that concludes negotiations.

1622
03:19:29.026 --> 03:19:30.224
I do not believe it.

1623
03:19:32.206 --> 03:19:33.613
I will not.

1624
03:19:49.671 --> 03:19:51.504
Pull back.

1625
03:19:51.756 --> 03:19:53.838
Pull back!

1626
03:20:06.041 --> 03:20:08.102
It's gone, Mr. Frodo.

1627
03:20:10.003 --> 03:20:13.549
The light's passed on, away towards the north.

1628
03:20:13.653 --> 03:20:15.569
Something's drawn its gaze.

1629
03:20:33.047 --> 03:20:35.840
Hold your ground! Hold your ground.

1630
03:20:37.687 --> 03:20:41.924
Sons of Gondor, of Rohan, my brothers!

1631
03:20:44.725 --> 03:20:46.682
I see in your eyes...

1632
03:20:47.019 --> 03:20:51.105
the same fear that would take the heart of me.

1633
03:20:53.066 --> 03:20:56.820
A day may come when the courage of Men fails...

1634
03:20:56.841 --> 03:21:00.439
when we forsake our friends and
break all bonds of fellowship.

1635
03:21:00.469 --> 03:21:03.285
But it is not this day.

1636
03:21:03.545 --> 03:21:06.613
An hour of wolves and shattered shields...

1637
03:21:06.778 --> 03:21:09.659
when the age of Men comes crashing down.

1638
03:21:09.801 --> 03:21:12.288
But it is not this day.

1639
03:21:12.460 --> 03:21:14.120
This day we fight!

1640
03:21:16.214 --> 03:21:20.254
By all that you hold dear on this good earth...

1641
03:21:20.426 --> 03:21:24.673
I bid you stand, Men of the West!

1642
03:22:53.132 --> 03:22:56.677
Never thought I'd die fighting
side by side with an Elf.

1643
03:22:57.146 --> 03:22:59.471
What about side by side with a friend?

1644
03:23:02.985 --> 03:23:04.770
Aye.

1645
03:23:05.592 --> 03:23:07.404
I could do that.

1646
03:23:37.706 --> 03:23:39.803
Do you remember the Shire, Mr. Frodo?

1647
03:23:42.763 --> 03:23:45.016
It'll be spring soon.

1648
03:23:45.787 --> 03:23:48.523
And the orchards will be in blossom.

1649
03:23:48.655 --> 03:23:52.361
And the birds will be nesting in the hazel thicket.

1650
03:23:53.712 --> 03:23:57.741
And they'll be sowing the summer
barley in the lower fields...

1651
03:23:58.769 --> 03:24:03.167
and eating the first of the strawberries with cream.

1652
03:24:05.077 --> 03:24:07.578
Do you remember the taste of strawberries?

1653
03:24:09.143 --> 03:24:10.883
No, Sam.

1654
03:24:11.020 --> 03:24:14.005
I can't recall the taste of food...

1655
03:24:15.139 --> 03:24:18.424
nor the sound of water...

1656
03:24:18.580 --> 03:24:22.183
nor the touch of grass.

1657
03:24:23.115 --> 03:24:24.689
I'm...

1658
03:24:25.566 --> 03:24:26.941
naked in the dark.

1659
03:24:28.589 --> 03:24:30.899
There's... there's nothing.

1660
03:24:31.040 --> 03:24:35.780
No veil between me and the wheel of fire.

1661
03:24:37.035 --> 03:24:38.944
I can see him...

1662
03:24:39.329 --> 03:24:41.031
with my waking eyes.

1663
03:24:42.040 --> 03:24:44.537
Then let us be rid of it...

1664
03:24:45.116 --> 03:24:47.368
once and for all.

1665
03:24:48.088 --> 03:24:50.164
Come on, Mr. Frodo.

1666
03:24:50.329 --> 03:24:52.961
I can't carry it for you...

1667
03:24:53.353 --> 03:24:55.424
but I can carry you.

1668
03:24:55.960 --> 03:24:57.714
Come on!

1669
03:25:28.127 --> 03:25:31.081
Aragorn.

1670
03:25:42.620 --> 03:25:46.374
Elessar.

1671
03:25:57.218 --> 03:25:59.646
For Frodo.

1672
03:26:34.598 --> 03:26:36.103
Look, Mr. Frodo.

1673
03:26:36.788 --> 03:26:39.025
A doorway.

1674
03:26:39.603 --> 03:26:41.273
We're almost there.

1675
03:26:43.617 --> 03:26:47.567
Clever Hobbits to climb so high!

1676
03:27:01.499 --> 03:27:03.170
Mustn't go that way.

1677
03:27:04.679 --> 03:27:07.177
Mustn't hurt the precious.

1678
03:27:07.338 --> 03:27:09.092
You swore!

1679
03:27:09.267 --> 03:27:11.343
You swore on the precious!

1680
03:27:13.229 --> 03:27:15.187
Smeagol promised!

1681
03:27:16.097 --> 03:27:18.100
Smeagol lied.

1682
03:28:10.577 --> 03:28:12.493
Frodo!

1683
03:28:39.564 --> 03:28:41.349
Eagles.

1684
03:28:42.744 --> 03:28:44.269
The eagles are coming!

1685
03:29:07.091 --> 03:29:08.964
Frodo!

1686
03:29:14.181 --> 03:29:15.503
I'm here, Sam.

1687
03:29:22.940 --> 03:29:24.606
Destroy it!

1688
03:29:35.139 --> 03:29:38.445
Go on! Now!

1689
03:29:38.580 --> 03:29:41.159
Throw it in the fire!

1690
03:29:54.533 --> 03:29:57.223
What are you waiting for?

1691
03:29:59.069 --> 03:30:01.472
Just let it go!

1692
03:30:34.676 --> 03:30:36.918
The Ring is mine.

1693
03:30:40.463 --> 03:30:42.217
No.

1694
03:30:42.601 --> 03:30:43.923
No.

1695
03:30:52.350 --> 03:30:55.029
No!

1696
03:32:39.434 --> 03:32:41.339
Yes!

1697
03:32:42.510 --> 03:32:44.217
Yes!

1698
03:32:45.325 --> 03:32:48.216
Precious! Precious!

1699
03:32:48.349 --> 03:32:51.557
Precious! Precious!

1700
03:33:44.445 --> 03:33:46.314
Give me your hand!

1701
03:33:54.663 --> 03:33:57.071
Take my hand!

1702
03:33:59.720 --> 03:34:01.080
No!

1703
03:34:08.323 --> 03:34:10.300
Don't you let go.

1704
03:34:14.891 --> 03:34:16.469
Don't let go.

1705
03:34:18.072 --> 03:34:19.562
Reach!

1706
03:35:48.733 --> 03:35:51.604
Frodo!

1707
03:35:52.174 --> 03:35:55.196
Frodo!

1708
03:37:16.527 --> 03:37:18.396
It's gone.

1709
03:37:22.835 --> 03:37:24.610
It's done.

1710
03:37:25.077 --> 03:37:27.112
Yes, Mr. Frodo.

1711
03:37:28.466 --> 03:37:30.905
It's over now.

1712
03:37:56.566 --> 03:37:58.938
I can see the Shire.

1713
03:38:01.154 --> 03:38:03.479
The Brandywine River.

1714
03:38:05.586 --> 03:38:07.609
Bag End.

1715
03:38:09.913 --> 03:38:12.659
Gandalf's fireworks.

1716
03:38:13.041 --> 03:38:16.831
The lights in the Party Tree.

1717
03:38:18.306 --> 03:38:21.457
Rosie Cotton dancing.

1718
03:38:22.581 --> 03:38:25.296
She had ribbons in her hair.

1719
03:38:28.212 --> 03:38:31.176
If ever I was to marry someone...

1720
03:38:32.070 --> 03:38:34.343
it would've been her.

1721
03:38:35.771 --> 03:38:37.847
It would've been her.

1722
03:38:49.952 --> 03:38:53.202
I'm glad to be with you, Samwise Gamgee...

1723
03:38:57.459 --> 03:39:00.418
here at the end of all things.

1724
03:40:50.069 --> 03:40:52.150
Gandalf?

1725
03:41:11.757 --> 03:41:13.791
Frodo!

1726
03:41:33.549 --> 03:41:35.397
Gimli!

1727
03:43:18.339 --> 03:43:22.129
Now come the days of the king.

1728
03:43:27.098 --> 03:43:29.464
May they be blessed.

1729
03:43:49.724 --> 03:43:52.414
This day does not belong to one man...

1730
03:43:52.539 --> 03:43:54.455
but to all.

1731
03:43:56.084 --> 03:43:59.043
Let us together rebuild this world...

1732
03:43:59.212 --> 03:44:03.459
that we may share in the days of peace.

1733
03:44:15.582 --> 03:44:19.753
Et Earello...
(Out of the Great Sea...)

1734
03:44:20.014 --> 03:44:27.365
Endorenna utulien.
(to Middle-Earth I am come.)

1735
03:44:28.929 --> 03:44:32.787
Sinome maruvan...
(In this place will I abide...)

1736
03:44:33.621 --> 03:44:39.564
ar Hildinyar...
(and my heirs...)

1737
03:44:40.398 --> 03:44:49.470
tenn' Ambar-metta.
(unto the ending of the world.)

1738
03:44:57.915 --> 03:44:59.375
Hannon le.
(Thank you.)

1739
03:46:37.909 --> 03:46:40.027
My friends...

1740
03:46:45.312 --> 03:46:48.002
you bow to no one.

1741
03:47:32.129 --> 03:47:34.293
And thus it was.

1742
03:47:34.423 --> 03:47:38.082
A Fourth Age of Middle-earth began.

1743
03:47:38.228 --> 03:47:40.798
And the Fellowship of the Ring...

1744
03:47:40.939 --> 03:47:45.467
though eternally bound by friendship and love...

1745
03:47:45.631 --> 03:47:48.049
was ended.

1746
03:47:53.035 --> 03:47:57.858
Thirteen months to the day since
Gandalf sent us on our long journey...

1747
03:47:57.987 --> 03:48:02.240
we found ourselves looking upon a familiar sight.

1748
03:48:04.765 --> 03:48:07.490
We were home.

1749
03:48:14.045 --> 03:48:15.918
Hi.

1750
03:48:33.074 --> 03:48:35.311
Hey, watch the pumpkin.

1751
03:49:23.383 --> 03:49:24.982
More of the same, Rosie.

1752
03:49:25.156 --> 03:49:27.148
Good night, lads.

1753
03:50:24.693 --> 03:50:28.712
How do you pick up the threads of an old life?

1754
03:50:30.011 --> 03:50:32.259
How do you go on...

1755
03:50:32.409 --> 03:50:37.637
when in your heart you begin to understand...

1756
03:50:38.874 --> 03:50:41.848
there is no going back?

1757
03:50:42.523 --> 03:50:46.230
There are some things that time cannot mend...

1758
03:50:46.694 --> 03:50:49.653
some hurts that go too deep...

1759
03:50:51.386 --> 03:50:54.242
that have taken hold.

1760
03:51:32.363 --> 03:51:34.279
Mr. Frodo?

1761
03:51:37.577 --> 03:51:38.994
What is it?

1762
03:51:40.809 --> 03:51:44.780
It's been four years to the day since Weathertop, Sam.

1763
03:51:45.449 --> 03:51:48.164
It's never really healed.

1764
03:51:52.122 --> 03:51:57.388
"There and Back Again." A
Hobbit's tale by Bilbo Baggins.

1765
03:51:58.066 --> 03:52:01.924
And "The Lord of the Rings" by Frodo Baggins.

1766
03:52:02.393 --> 03:52:04.593
You finished it.

1767
03:52:07.450 --> 03:52:08.975
Not quite.

1768
03:52:09.744 --> 03:52:12.355
There's room for a little more.

1769
03:52:14.957 --> 03:52:19.200
Bilbo once told me his part in this tale would end...

1770
03:52:19.336 --> 03:52:22.653
that each of us must come and go in the telling.

1771
03:52:23.507 --> 03:52:26.373
Bilbo's story was now over.

1772
03:52:26.844 --> 03:52:29.792
There would be no more journeys for him...

1773
03:52:29.920 --> 03:52:31.503
save one.

1774
03:52:32.214 --> 03:52:35.863
Tell me again, lad, where are we going?

1775
03:52:35.967 --> 03:52:38.001
To the harbor, Bilbo.

1776
03:52:38.157 --> 03:52:40.882
The Elves have accorded you a special honor...

1777
03:52:41.024 --> 03:52:43.677
a place on the last ship to leave Middle-earth.

1778
03:52:45.351 --> 03:52:47.053
Frodo...

1779
03:52:48.479 --> 03:52:53.022
any chance of seeing that old Ring of mine again?

1780
03:52:53.641 --> 03:52:55.893
The one I gave you.

1781
03:52:59.532 --> 03:53:01.690
I'm sorry, Uncle.

1782
03:53:04.224 --> 03:53:06.866
I'm afraid I lost it.

1783
03:53:07.039 --> 03:53:08.831
Oh.

1784
03:53:09.385 --> 03:53:10.917
Pity.

1785
03:53:13.660 --> 03:53:17.538
I should like to have held it one last time.

1786
03:53:46.661 --> 03:53:51.744
Well, here's a sight I have never seen before.

1787
03:54:05.899 --> 03:54:09.264
The power of the Three Rings is ended.

1788
03:54:10.017 --> 03:54:12.846
The time has come...

1789
03:54:12.989 --> 03:54:16.274
for the dominion of Men.

1790
03:54:16.795 --> 03:54:20.276
I Aear can ven na mar.
(The sea calls us home.)

1791
03:54:28.681 --> 03:54:30.861
I think I'm...

1792
03:54:31.028 --> 03:54:35.415
quite ready for another adventure.

1793
03:55:06.479 --> 03:55:08.778
Farewell...

1794
03:55:08.929 --> 03:55:11.702
my brave Hobbits.

1795
03:55:13.621 --> 03:55:15.655
My work is now finished.

1796
03:55:19.460 --> 03:55:24.461
Here at last, on the shores of the sea...

1797
03:55:25.091 --> 03:55:27.968
comes the end of our Fellowship.

1798
03:55:31.503 --> 03:55:34.005
I will not say, "Do not weep"...

1799
03:55:34.683 --> 03:55:38.681
for not all tears are an evil.

1800
03:55:56.215 --> 03:55:58.155
It is time, Frodo.

1801
03:56:03.670 --> 03:56:05.704
What does he mean?

1802
03:56:08.154 --> 03:56:11.045
We set out to save the Shire, Sam.

1803
03:56:12.637 --> 03:56:15.389
And it has been saved.

1804
03:56:19.050 --> 03:56:21.729
But not for me.

1805
03:56:22.647 --> 03:56:25.103
You don't mean that.

1806
03:56:26.296 --> 03:56:28.393
You can't leave.

1807
03:56:36.828 --> 03:56:39.574
The last pages are for you, Sam.

1808
04:00:12.663 --> 04:00:15.534
My dear Sam

1809
04:00:17.460 --> 04:00:20.793
You cannot always be torn in two.

1810
04:00:20.953 --> 04:00:25.091
You will have to be one and whole for many years.

1811
04:00:25.697 --> 04:00:31.299
