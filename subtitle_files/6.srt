1
00:01:17,286 --> 00:01:18,901
Smeéagol!

2
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,410
I've got one!

3
00:01:22,124 --> 00:01:23,955
I've got a fish, sméag. Smeagol!

4
00:01:24,126 --> 00:01:27,243
Pull it in. Go on. Go on. Go on.
Pull it in.

5
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,301
Smeagol: Déagol!

6
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:36,527
Smeagol: Déagol?

7
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,320
Deagol.

8
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:59,217
Give us that, deagol, my love.

9
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:05,469
Why?

10
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:08,802
Because

11
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:12,723
it's my birthday and I wants it.

12
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:52,032
My precious.

13
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:02,503
Gollum: They cursed us.

14
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:04,042
Murderer

15
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:06,678
"murderer" they called us.

16
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:11,638
They cursed us
and drove us away.

17
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:18,356
Gollum.

18
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:25,022
And we wept, precious.

19
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,784
We wept to be so alone.

20
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:35,161
And cool so nice for feet

21
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:40,538
and we only wish to catch a fish

22
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:43,957
so juicy sweet

23
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:53,842
And we forgot the taste of bread...

24
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:57,638
The sound of trees.

25
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:01,733
The softness of the wind.

26
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:08,028
We even forgot our own name.

27
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:22,584
My precious.

28
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:09,084
Wake up!

29
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:11,799
Wake up!

30
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:13,759
Wake up, sleepies.

31
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:15,799
We must go, yes.

32
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:18,639
We must go at once.

33
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:25,275
Haven't you had any sleep, Mr. Frodo?

34
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:30,026
I've gone and had too much.

35
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:33,149
Must be getting late.

36
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:34,818
Frodo: No.

37
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:36,907
It isn't.

38
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:40,119
It isn't midday yet.

39
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,375
The days are growing darker.

40
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,340
Come on!

41
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:54,004
Must go! No time!

42
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:56,548
Not before Mr. Frodo's
had something to eat.

43
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:59,593
Gollum: No time to lose, silly.

44
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:09,648
Sam: Here

45
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:14,698
what about you?

46
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:18,236
Oh, no, I'm not hungry.
Leastways, not for lembas bread.

47
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:20,197
Sam.

48
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:24,330
All right.

49
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,995
We don't have that much left.

50
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:30,040
We have to be careful
or we're going to run out.

51
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:35,132
You go ahead and eat that, Mr. Frodo.

52
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:36,716
I've rationed it.

53
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:38,886
There should be enough.

54
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,268
For what?

55
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,680
The journey home.

56
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,865
Gollum: Come, hobbitses.

57
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:59,110
Very close now.

58
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:02,531
Very close to mordor.

59
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:05,371
No safe places here.

60
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,706
Hurry.

61
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,806
Merry: It's good.

62
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:04,467
Definitely from the shire.

63
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:08,805
Longbottom leaf.

64
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:18,489
I feel like I'm back at
the green dragon.

65
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:22,827
- Mmm. Green dragon.
- A mug of ale in my hand.

66
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:27,582
Putting my feet up on a settle
after a hard day's work.

67
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:31,627
Only, you've never done
a hard day's work.

68
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:47,472
Welcome, my lords...

69
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,888
To isengard!

70
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:54,018
You young rascals!
A merry hunt you've led us on...

71
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:59,189
And now we find you feasting
and... and smoking!

72
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:02,575
We are sitting on a field of victory...

73
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:06,203
Enjoying a few well-earned comforts.

74
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:11,126
The salted pork is particularly good.

75
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:14,037
Salted pork?

76
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:18,670
Huh. Hobbits.
“We're under orders from treebeard

77
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:21,678
who's taken over management
of isengard.

78
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:27,217
Treebeard: Young master Gandalf.

79
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:31,980
I'm glad you've come.

80
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:36,564
Wood and water, stock and stone
I can master.

81
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:40,401
But there is a wizard to manage here...

82
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:42,566
Locked in his tower.

83
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:46,577
Show yourself.

84
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:48,537
Be careful.

85
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:51,954
Even in defeat, saruman is dangerous.

86
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:54,210
Well, let's just have his head
and be done with it

87
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,462
no

88
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,131
We need him alive.

89
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:02,673
We need him to talk.

90
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:08,800
Saruman: You have fought many wars
and slain many men, théoden king...

91
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:10,468
And made peace afterwards.

92
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:15,562
Can we not take counsel together
as we once did, my old friend?

93
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:18,985
Can we not have peace, you and I?

94
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:21,020
We shall have peace.

95
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:25,074
We shall have peace...

96
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:29,325
When you answer
for the burning of the westfold...

97
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:32,206
And the children that lie dead there!

98
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:37,166
We shall have peace
when the lives of the soldiers

99
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,376
whose bodies were hewn
even as they lay dead...

100
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:43,088
Against the gates of the hornburg,
are avenged!

101
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:50,221
When you hang from a gibbet
for the sport of your own crows...

102
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:53,394
We shall have peace.

103
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:58,854
(Ggibbets and crows?

104
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:00,435
Dotard!

105
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:04,739
What do you want, Gandalf greyhame?

106
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:08,234
Let me guess. The key of orthanc.

107
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:11,371
Or perhaps the keys of barad-dur itself...

108
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:15,534
Along with the crowns of the seven kings
and the rods of the five wizards!

109
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:18,624
Your treachery has already cost
many lives.

110
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,206
Thousands more are now at risk.

111
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:23,716
But you could save them, saruman.

112
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:26,218
You were deep in the enemy's counsel.

113
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:29,631
So you have come here for information.

114
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,391
I have some for you.

115
00:13:37,859 --> 00:13:40,771
Something festers
in the heart of middle-earth:

116
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:43,231
Something that you have failed to see.

117
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:49,234
But the great eye has seen it.

118
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:53,955
Even now he presses his advantage.

119
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:59,085
His attack will come soon.

120
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:03,418
You're all going to die.

121
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:09,136
But you know this, don't you, Gandalf?

122
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:13,926
You cannot think that this ranger
will ever sit upon the throne of gondor.

123
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:20,190
This exile, crept from the shadows,
will never be crowned king.

124
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:25,190
Gandalf does not hesitate
to sacrifice those closest to him.

125
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:28,322
Those he professes to love.

126
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:33,949
Tell me, what words of comfort
did you give the halfling...

127
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:36,489
Before you sent him to his doom?

128
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:44,289
The path that you have set him on
can only lead to death.

129
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:46,795
I've heard enough!

130
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:48,800
Shoot him.
Stick an arrow in his gob.

131
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:50,966
Gandalf: No.

132
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:53,639
Come down, saruman...

133
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:57,723
- And your life will be spared.
- Save your pity and your mercy.

134
00:14:57,939 --> 00:14:59,224
I have no use for it!

135
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:09,989
Gandalf: Saruman.

136
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:12,991
Your staff is broken.

137
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:28,499
Grima, you need not follow him.

138
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:32,341
You were not always as you are now.

139
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:35,348
You were once a man of Rohan.

140
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:36,724
Come down.

141
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:39,601
A man of Rohan?

142
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:42,764
What is the house of Rohan

143
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:46,602
but a thatched barn
where brigands drink in the reek...

144
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:50,522
And their brats roll on the floor
with the dogs?

145
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:57,495
The victory at helm's deep does not
belong to you, théoden horse-master.

146
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:02,701
You are a lesser son of greater sires.

147
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:06,708
Grima...

148
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:09,415
Come down.

149
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,216
Be free of him.

150
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:15,380
- Free? He will never be free.
- No.

151
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:18,387
Get down, cur!

152
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:21,393
Saruman!

153
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:24,226
You were deep in the enemy's counsel.

154
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:26,895
Tell us what you know!

155
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:33,615
You withdraw your guard, and I will tell
you where your doom will be decided.

156
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:36,742
I will not be held prisoner here.

157
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:06,060
Send word to all our allies.

158
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:09,101
And to every corner of middle-earth
that still stands free

159
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:12,775
the enemy moves against us.
We need to know where he will strike.

160
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:35,881
The filth of saruman_

161
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:39,885
Is washing away.

162
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:44,640
Trees will come back to live here.

163
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:47,308
Young trees.

164
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,644
- Wild trees.
- Pippin!

165
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:01,322
Bless my bark!

166
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:03,328
Gandalf: Peregrin took!

167
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:06,161
I'll take that, my lad.

168
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:08,166
Quickly, now.

169
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:03,927
Theoden: Tonight we remember those who
gave their blood to defend this country.

170
00:19:04,602 --> 00:19:06,638
Hail the victorious dead.

171
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:21,106
No pauses.

172
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:25,449
- No spills.
- And no regurgitation.

173
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:27,617
So it's a drinking game?

174
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:31,784
Last one standing wins.

175
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:38,294
Man: What'll we drink to?
Let's drink to victory!

176
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:39,800
Men: To victory!

177
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:25,467
Theoden: I am happy for you.

178
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:28,265
He is an honorable man.

179
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:31,135
You are both honorable men.

180
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:38,318
It was not theoden of Rohan
who led our people to victory.

181
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:48,319
Ah, don't listen to me.

182
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:50,655
You are young.

183
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:53,165
And tonight is for you.

184
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:09,177
Here, here.

185
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:16,556
It's the dwarves that go swimming
with little, hairy women.

186
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:23,187
I feel something.

187
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:27,858
A slight tingle in my fingers.

188
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:30,118
I think it's affecting me.

189
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:33,747
What did I say?

190
00:21:33,918 --> 00:21:37,251
He can't hold his liquor.

191
00:21:44,595 --> 00:21:45,926
(Same over.

192
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:48,462
Merry & pippin:
Oh, you can search far and wide

193
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:50,097
you can drink the whole town dry

194
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:53,634
but you'll never find a beer so brown
but you'll never find a beer so brown

195
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:58,223
as the one we drink in our hometown
as the one we drink in our hometown

196
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,268
you can drink your fancy ales
you can drink 'em by the flagon

197
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:05,609
but the only brew for the brave and true

198
00:22:08,244 --> 00:22:09,575
pippin!

199
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:13,078
Merry & pippin:
But the only brew for the brave and true

200
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:15,451
comes from the green dragon

201
00:22:18,796 --> 00:22:21,629
merry: Thank you! I win!

202
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:25,916
No news of Frodo?

203
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:29,587
No word. Nothing.

204
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:32,593
We have time.

205
00:22:34,103 --> 00:22:37,391
Every day, Frodo moves closer to mordor.

206
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:40,189
Do we know that?

207
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:45,769
What does your heart tell you?

208
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:56,121
That Frodo is alive.

209
00:22:58,294 --> 00:23:00,125
Yes

210
00:23:02,673 --> 00:23:04,664
yes, he's alive.

211
00:23:07,136 --> 00:23:09,969
Gollum: Too risky. Too risky.

212
00:23:10,139 --> 00:23:11,345
Thieves.

213
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:13,551
They stole it from us.

214
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:16,809
Kill them. Kill them. Kill them both.

215
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:22,148
Shh! Quiet! Mustn't wake them.

216
00:23:22,318 --> 00:23:24,809
Mustn't ruin it now.

217
00:23:24,987 --> 00:23:27,069
But they knows.

218
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:29,150
They knows.

219
00:23:29,325 --> 00:23:31,941
They suspects us.

220
00:23:33,162 --> 00:23:36,654
What's it saying, my precious, my love?

221
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:40,450
Is smeagol losing his nerve?

222
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:43,498
No. Not.

223
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:47,881
Never. Sméagol hates nasty hobbitses.

224
00:23:48,052 --> 00:23:52,887
Smeéagol wants to see them dead.

225
00:23:53,057 --> 00:23:55,594
And we will

226
00:23:55,768 --> 00:23:59,852
smeagol did it once.
He can do it again.

227
00:24:03,192 --> 00:24:05,854
It's ours!

228
00:24:06,028 --> 00:24:08,690
Ours!

229
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:12,694
We must get the precious.
We must get it back.

230
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:16,235
Patience! Patience, my love.

231
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:20,782
First we must lead them to her.

232
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:26,704
We lead them to the winding stair.

233
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:29,544
Yes, the stairs. And then?

234
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:32,710
Up, up, up, up,
up the stairs we go...

235
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:39,259
Until we come to the tunnel.

236
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:42,762
And when they go in...

237
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:45,727
There's no coming out.

238
00:24:46,652 --> 00:24:49,564
She's always hungry.

239
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:54,489
She always needs to feed.

240
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,070
She must eat.

241
00:24:56,245 --> 00:24:58,406
All she gets is filthy orcses.

242
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:01,287
And they doesn't taste very nice,
does they, precious?

243
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:03,578
No

244
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:08,416
Not very nice at all, my love.

245
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:11,423
She hungers for sweeter meats.

246
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:13,424
Hobbit meat.

247
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:18,430
And when she throws away the bones
and the empty clothes...

248
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,637
Then we will find it.

249
00:25:21,812 --> 00:25:26,146
And take it for me!

250
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:29,308
For us.

251
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:32,812
Yes we meant "for us.”

252
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:36,448
Gollum. Gollum.

253
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:41,112
The precious will be ours...

254
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:45,784
Once the hobbitses are dead!

255
00:25:46,295 --> 00:25:47,785
You treacherous little toad!

256
00:25:50,466 --> 00:25:52,798
No! No! Master!

257
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:54,583
No, Sam! Leave him alone!

258
00:25:55,471 --> 00:25:58,133
I heard it from his own mouth.
He means to murder us.

259
00:25:58,307 --> 00:26:02,471
Never! Sméagol wouldn't hurt a fly.

260
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,516
He's a horrid, fat hobbit...

261
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,305
Who hates smeéagol...

262
00:26:08,484 --> 00:26:11,226
And who makes up nasty lies.

263
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:14,110
You miserable little maggot!
I'll stove your head in!

264
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:15,730
Sam!

265
00:26:16,158 --> 00:26:17,694
Sam:
Call me a liar? You're a liar!

266
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:23,328
- You scare him off, we're lost!
- I don't care! I can't do it, Mr. Frodo.

267
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:26,662
- I won't wait around for him to kill us!
- I'm not sending him away.

268
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:28,333
Sam: You don't see it, do you?

269
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:30,168
He's a villain.

270
00:26:31,173 --> 00:26:34,757
We can't do this by ourselves, Sam.
Not without a guide.

271
00:26:35,636 --> 00:26:38,503
I need you on my side.

272
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:41,630
I'm on your side, Mr. Frodo.

273
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:46,055
I know, Sam. I know.

274
00:26:46,647 --> 00:26:48,603
Trust me.

275
00:26:48,774 --> 00:26:51,186
Come, smeagol.

276
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:00,584
What time is it?

277
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:04,421
Not yet dawn.

278
00:28:11,315 --> 00:28:14,352
I dreamed I saw a great wave...

279
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:18,519
Climbing over green lands
and above the hills.

280
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:22,272
I stood upon the brink.

281
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:26,323
It was utterly dark in the abyss
before my feet.

282
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:31,032
A light shone behind me...

283
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:34,125
But I could not turn.

284
00:28:34,296 --> 00:28:37,663
I could only stand there, waiting.

285
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:41,841
Night changes many thoughts.

286
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:44,378
Sleep, eowyn.

287
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:47,180
Sleep...

288
00:28:49,895 --> 00:28:51,806
While you can.

289
00:29:15,921 --> 00:29:18,207
The stars are veiled.

290
00:29:19,216 --> 00:29:22,708
Something stirs in the east.

291
00:29:23,387 --> 00:29:26,504
A sleepless malice.

292
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,387
The eye of the enemy is moving.

293
00:29:44,825 --> 00:29:47,532
Merry: What are you doing?

294
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:53,621
Merry: Pippin!

295
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:02,873
Pippin?

296
00:30:15,731 --> 00:30:17,062
Pippin.

297
00:30:17,733 --> 00:30:20,395
- What, are you mad?
- I just want to look at it.

298
00:30:20,569 --> 00:30:21,649
Just one more time.

299
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:23,985
Merry: Put it back.

300
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:36,080
Pippin.

301
00:30:42,591 --> 00:30:44,081
No!

302
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:50,507
Pippin.

303
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:55,016
He is here.

304
00:30:55,187 --> 00:30:57,473
Sauron: I see you.

305
00:31:00,484 --> 00:31:02,099
Pippin!

306
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:19,492
Merry: Help! Gandalf, help!

307
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:23,119
Someone help him!

308
00:31:29,513 --> 00:31:30,719
Pippin!

309
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:33,088
Fool of a took!

310
00:31:54,204 --> 00:31:56,411
I ook at me.

311
00:31:58,375 --> 00:32:02,493
(Gandalf, forgive me.

312
00:32:02,671 --> 00:32:04,536
Gandalf: I ook at me.

313
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:06,545
What did you see?

314
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:12,135
A tree.

315
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:14,963
There was a white tree

316
00:32:15,142 --> 00:32:16,632
in a courtyard of stone.

317
00:32:19,438 --> 00:32:20,723
It was dead.

318
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:26,732
The city was burning.

319
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:30,270
Minas tirith? Is that what you saw?

320
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:32,985
I saw

321
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:37,736
I saw him.

322
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,991
I could hear his voice in my head.

323
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:45,582
And what did you tell him?

324
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:47,586
Speak!

325
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:54,924
He asked me my name.
I didn't answer.

326
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:56,554
He hurt me.

327
00:32:56,725 --> 00:32:59,182
What did you tell him
about Frodo and the ring?

328
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:05,146
There was no lie in pippin's eyes.

329
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:08,225
A fool

330
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:10,689
but an honest fool he remains.

331
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:14,694
He told Sauron nothing
of Frodo and the ring.

332
00:33:15,744 --> 00:33:18,110
We've been strangely fortunate.

333
00:33:18,288 --> 00:33:22,156
Pippin saw in the palantir
a glimpse of the enemy's plan.

334
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:27,043
Sauron moves to strike
the city of minas tirith.

335
00:33:27,631 --> 00:33:31,374
His defeat at helm's deep
showed our enemy one thing.

336
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:33,883
He knows the heir of elendil
has come forth.

337
00:33:34,054 --> 00:33:36,170
Men are not as weak as he supposed.

338
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:40,136
There is courage still, strength
enough perhaps to challenge him.

339
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:42,217
Sauron fears this.

340
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:46,729
He will not risk the peoples of
middle-earth uniting under one banner.

341
00:33:47,901 --> 00:33:50,313
He will raze minas tirith
to the ground...

342
00:33:50,487 --> 00:33:53,979
Before he sees a king
return to the throne of men.

343
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:58,070
If the beacons of gondor are lit,
Rohan must be ready for war.

344
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:01,202
Tell me.

345
00:34:01,373 --> 00:34:05,161
Why should we ride to the aid
of those who did not come to ours?

346
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,878
What do we owe gondor?

347
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:14,044
- I will go.
- No!

348
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:17,382
- They must be warned.
- They will be.

349
00:34:20,809 --> 00:34:23,346
You must come to minas tirith
by another road.

350
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:28,355
Follow the river.
Look to the black ships.

351
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:31,273
Understand this:

352
00:34:31,444 --> 00:34:35,107
Things are now in motion
that cannot be undone.

353
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:38,698
I ride for minas tirith __

354
00:34:40,954 --> 00:34:43,616
And I won't be going alone.

355
00:34:45,375 --> 00:34:49,038
Of all the inquisitive hobbits,
peregrin took, you are the worst.

356
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:51,707
Hurry! Hurry!

357
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:54,626
Where are we going?

358
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:56,041
Why did you look?

359
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:58,961
Why do you always have to look?

360
00:34:59,139 --> 00:35:02,222
I don't know. I can't help it.
You never can.

361
00:35:02,684 --> 00:35:04,094
I'm sorry, all right?

362
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:09,099
- I won't do it again.
- Don't you understand?

363
00:35:09,858 --> 00:35:11,814
The enemy thinks you have the ring.

364
00:35:11,985 --> 00:35:15,728
He's going to be looking for you, pip.
They have to get you out of here.

365
00:35:17,157 --> 00:35:19,819
And you...? You're coming with me?

366
00:35:22,037 --> 00:35:23,447
Merry?

367
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:24,907
Come on.

368
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:31,785
How far is minas tirith?

369
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:34,579
Three days' ride, as the nazgul flies.

370
00:35:34,758 --> 00:35:38,250
And you better hope we don't have
one of those on our tail

371
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,460
here

372
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:42,425
something for the road.

373
00:35:43,308 --> 00:35:45,264
The last of the Longbottom leaf.

374
00:35:45,435 --> 00:35:49,428
I know you've run out.
You smoke too much, pippin.

375
00:35:49,606 --> 00:35:52,097
But... but we'll see each other soon.

376
00:35:55,445 --> 00:35:57,936
- Won't we?
- I don't know.

377
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:01,985
I don't know what's going to happen.

378
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,866
- Merry.
- Run, shadowfax.

379
00:36:04,037 --> 00:36:05,493
Show us the meaning of haste.

380
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:07,575
Merry!

381
00:36:18,051 --> 00:36:19,166
Merry!

382
00:36:29,646 --> 00:36:31,136
He's always followed me...

383
00:36:31,815 --> 00:36:33,851
Everywhere I went...

384
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:35,978
Since before we were tweens.

385
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:41,066
I would get him into
the worst sort of trouble

386
00:36:41,241 --> 00:36:43,323
but I was always there to get him out.

387
00:36:45,787 --> 00:36:47,652
Now he's gone.

388
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:52,244
Just like Frodo and Sam.

389
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:55,619
One thing I have learned about hobbits:

390
00:36:55,797 --> 00:36:57,458
They're a most Hardy folk.

391
00:36:58,007 --> 00:37:01,716
Foolhardy, maybe. He's a took.

392
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:18,478
Elrond:
Take her by the safest road.

393
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:21,144
A ship lies anchored
in the grey havens.

394
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:25,190
It walls to carry her across the sea.

395
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:28,735
The last journey of arwen undomiel.

396
00:38:34,354 --> 00:38:37,437
There is nothing for you here...

397
00:38:37,941 --> 00:38:40,148
Only death.

398
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:48,735
Elf escort: Lady arwen...

399
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:51,572
We cannot delay.

400
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,280
My lady!

401
00:39:14,686 --> 00:39:17,302
Arwen: Tell me what you have seen.
Elrond: Arwen.

402
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,436
Arwen:
You have the gift of foresight.

403
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:21,393
What did you see?

404
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:25,359
I looked into your future,
and I saw death.

405
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:28,021
But there is also life.

406
00:39:29,951 --> 00:39:33,990
You saw there was a child.
You saw my son.

407
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:37,159
Elrond:
That future is almost gone.

408
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:39,324
But it is not lost.

409
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:44,128
Nothing is certain.

410
00:39:45,842 --> 00:39:48,549
Some things are certain.

411
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:55,181
If I leave him now.

412
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:57,967
I will regret it forever.

413
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:01,395
It is time.

414
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:10,442
Arwen:
From the ashes a fire shall be woken

415
00:40:10,617 --> 00:40:14,030
a light from the shadow shall spring

416
00:40:14,203 --> 00:40:17,491
renewed shall be blade that was broken

417
00:40:24,881 --> 00:40:28,089
The crownless again shall be king

418
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:33,882
re-forge the sword.

419
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:17,964
The life of the eldar is leaving you.

420
00:41:21,396 --> 00:41:23,307
This was my choice.

421
00:41:28,778 --> 00:41:33,067
There is no ship now
that can bear me hence.

422
00:42:20,288 --> 00:42:23,121
We've just passed
into the realm of gondor.

423
00:42:34,761 --> 00:42:37,002
Minas tirith.

424
00:42:37,597 --> 00:42:39,929
City of kings.

425
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:13,083
Make way!

426
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:44,117
It's the tree.

427
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:45,949
(Gandalf. Gandalf.

428
00:43:46,124 --> 00:43:48,365
Gandalf:
Yes, the white tree of gondor.

429
00:43:48,543 --> 00:43:50,374
The tree of the king.

430
00:43:50,545 --> 00:43:53,207
Lord denethor, however,
is not king.

431
00:43:53,381 --> 00:43:56,043
He is a steward only,
9 caretaker of the throne.

432
00:43:56,801 --> 00:44:00,339
Now listen carefully.
I ord denethor is Boromir's father.

433
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:04,676
To give him news of his beloved son's
death would be most unwise

434
00:44:05,143 --> 00:44:08,601
and do not mention Frodo or the ring.

435
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:12,222
And say nothing of aragorn either.

436
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:17,936
In fact, it's better if you
don't speak at all, peregrin took.

437
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:54,598
Hail denethor, son of ecthelion,
lord and steward of gondor.

438
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:04,824
I come with tidings in this dark hour,
and with counsel

439
00:45:05,786 --> 00:45:09,153
perhaps you come to explain this.

440
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:19,334
Perhaps you come to tell me
why my son is dead.

441
00:45:33,814 --> 00:45:36,806
Boromir died to save us.

442
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:38,645
My kinsman and me.

443
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:42,311
- He fell defending us from many foes.
- Pippin.

444
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:51,286
I offer you my service, such as it is...

445
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:53,823
In payment of this debt.

446
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:59,336
This is my first command to you.

447
00:46:00,049 --> 00:46:03,507
How did you escape
and my son did not...

448
00:46:03,844 --> 00:46:06,176
So mighty a man as he was?

449
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:10,180
The mightiest man
may be slain by one arrow...

450
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:12,345
And Boromir was pierced by many.

451
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:18,188
Get up.

452
00:46:18,359 --> 00:46:22,978
My lord, there will be a time
to grieve for Boromir...

453
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:25,187
But it is not now.

454
00:46:25,908 --> 00:46:28,115
War is coming.

455
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:32,866
The enemy is on your doorstep.
As steward, you are charged...

456
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:37,204
With the defense of this city.
Where are gondor's armies?

457
00:46:37,378 --> 00:46:42,247
You still have friends.
You are not alone in this fight.

458
00:46:42,425 --> 00:46:46,919
Send word to théoden of Rohan.
Light the beacons.

459
00:46:48,514 --> 00:46:52,052
You think you are wise, mithrandir.

460
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:55,263
Yet for all your subtleties,
you have not wisdom.

461
00:46:57,398 --> 00:47:01,562
Do you think the eyes
of the white tower are blind?

462
00:47:01,736 --> 00:47:04,819
I have seen more than you know.

463
00:47:04,989 --> 00:47:08,197
With your left hand you would use me
as a shield against mordor.

464
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:11,234
And with your right
you'd seek to supplant me.

465
00:47:11,412 --> 00:47:15,121
I know who rides with théoden of Rohan.

466
00:47:15,291 --> 00:47:21,252
Oh, yes. Word has reached my ears
of this aragorn, son of arathorn.

467
00:47:21,422 --> 00:47:26,257
And I tell you now, I will not bow
to this ranger from the north...

468
00:47:26,427 --> 00:47:30,921
Last of a ragged house
long bereft of lordship.

469
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:36,934
Authority is not given to you
to deny the return of the king, steward.

470
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:41,518
The rule of gondor is mine
and no other's.

471
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:48,483
Gandalf: Come.

472
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:58,997
All has turned to vain ambition.

473
00:47:59,168 --> 00:48:02,626
He would even use his grief
as a cloak.

474
00:48:05,508 --> 00:48:08,295
A thousand years
this city has stood.

475
00:48:09,387 --> 00:48:11,799
Now, at the whim of a madman,
it will fall.

476
00:48:13,015 --> 00:48:15,222
And the white tree,
the tree of the king...

477
00:48:15,393 --> 00:48:16,929
Will never bloom again.

478
00:48:17,103 --> 00:48:18,809
Pippin:
Why are they still guarding it?

479
00:48:18,979 --> 00:48:21,015
Gandalf:
They guard it because they have hope.

480
00:48:21,190 --> 00:48:23,806
A faint and fading hope
that one day it will flower.

481
00:48:23,984 --> 00:48:28,728
That a king will come
and this city will be as it once was...

482
00:48:31,992 --> 00:48:35,234
The old wisdom borne out
of the west was forsaken.

483
00:48:35,413 --> 00:48:39,702
Kings made tombs more splendid
than the houses of the living...

484
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:41,828
And counted the old names
of their descent

485
00:48:42,002 --> 00:48:44,789
dearer than the names of their sons.

486
00:48:44,964 --> 00:48:50,004
Childless lords sat in aged halls,
musing on heraldry...

487
00:48:50,177 --> 00:48:55,513
Or in high, cold towers,
asking questions of the stars.

488
00:48:55,683 --> 00:48:59,471
And so the people of gondor
fell into ruin.

489
00:49:00,438 --> 00:49:02,770
The line of kings failed.

490
00:49:03,482 --> 00:49:05,848
The white tree withered.

491
00:49:06,569 --> 00:49:10,733
The rule of gondor was given over
to lesser men.

492
00:49:21,459 --> 00:49:22,699
Mordor.

493
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:26,873
Yes, there it lies.

494
00:49:27,715 --> 00:49:31,048
This city has dwelt ever
in the sight of its shadow.

495
00:49:33,053 --> 00:49:34,714
A storm is coming.

496
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:38,301
This is not the weather of the world.

497
00:49:38,476 --> 00:49:40,683
This is a device of Sauron's making.

498
00:49:40,853 --> 00:49:44,596
A broil of fume
he sends ahead of his host

499
00:49:45,191 --> 00:49:47,648
the orcs of mordor
have no love of daylight...

500
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:49,649
Gn he covers the face of the sun.

501
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:53,563
To ease their passage
along the road to war.

502
00:49:53,741 --> 00:49:57,029
When the shadow of mordor
reaches this city...

503
00:49:57,745 --> 00:49:59,451
It will begin.

504
00:50:01,123 --> 00:50:02,704
Well

505
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:04,414
minas tirith __

506
00:50:06,337 --> 00:50:07,702
Very impressive.

507
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:10,641
- So where are we off to next?
- Oh, it's too late for that, peregrin.

508
00:50:10,716 --> 00:50:12,923
There's no leaving this city.

509
00:50:15,262 --> 00:50:18,379
Help must come to us.

510
00:50:19,975 --> 00:50:22,637
Sam:
It must be getting near teatime.

511
00:50:22,811 --> 00:50:26,520
Leastways, it would be in decent places
where there is still teatime.

512
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:30,274
We're not in decent places.

513
00:50:35,824 --> 00:50:37,064
Mr Frodo?

514
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:41,326
What is it?

515
00:50:43,791 --> 00:50:46,157
It's just a feeling.

516
00:50:48,587 --> 00:50:50,748
I don't think I'll be coming back.

517
00:50:55,261 --> 00:50:57,798
Yes, you will. Of course you will.

518
00:50:58,430 --> 00:51:00,295
That's just morbid thinking.

519
00:51:00,766 --> 00:51:03,223
We're going there and back again...

520
00:51:03,394 --> 00:51:05,680
Just like Mr. bilbo.

521
00:51:06,647 --> 00:51:08,763
You'll see.

522
00:51:16,949 --> 00:51:20,567
Frodo: I think these lands
were once part of the kingdom of gondor.

523
00:51:24,957 --> 00:51:28,996
Long ago, when there was a king.

524
00:51:49,648 --> 00:51:52,481
Mr. Frodo, look.

525
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:56,853
The king has got a crown again.

526
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:12,243
Come on, hobbits!
Mustn't stop now. This way.

527
00:52:29,104 --> 00:52:33,143
So I imagine this is just
a ceremonial position.

528
00:52:33,317 --> 00:52:37,560
I mean, they don't actually expect me
to do any fighting.

529
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:41,647
Do they?
You're in the service of the steward now.

530
00:52:41,825 --> 00:52:45,192
You'll have to do as you're told,
peregrin took.

531
00:52:49,249 --> 00:52:51,740
Ridiculous hobbit.

532
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:55,127
Guard of the citadel

533
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:06,471
Thank you.

534
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:18,100
There's no more stars.

535
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:19,818
Is it time?

536
00:53:20,989 --> 00:53:22,729
Yes

537
00:53:25,369 --> 00:53:27,030
it's so quiet.

538
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:32,281
It's the deep breath before the plunge.

539
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:36,327
I don't want to be in a battle

540
00:53:37,172 --> 00:53:42,132
but waiting on the edge of one
I can't escape is even worse.

541
00:53:45,681 --> 00:53:49,299
Is there any hope, Gandalf,
for Frodo and Sam?

542
00:53:50,644 --> 00:53:53,761
Gandalf:
There never was much hope.

543
00:53:55,733 --> 00:53:57,473
Just a fool's hope.

544
00:54:03,365 --> 00:54:06,152
Our enemy is ready.

545
00:54:06,326 --> 00:54:08,988
His full strength's gathered.

546
00:54:09,163 --> 00:54:12,655
Not only orcs, but men as well.

547
00:54:12,833 --> 00:54:15,870
Legions of haradrim from the south...

548
00:54:16,044 --> 00:54:18,751
Mercenaries from the coast

549
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:21,504
all will answer mordor's call.

550
00:54:21,675 --> 00:54:23,211
Man: Come on.

551
00:54:24,344 --> 00:54:27,677
This will be the end of gondor
a8 we know it.

552
00:54:27,848 --> 00:54:31,215
Here the hammer stroke will fall hardest.

553
00:54:32,186 --> 00:54:36,520
If the river is taken,
if the Garrison at osgiliath falls...

554
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:40,353
The last defense of this city
will be gone.

555
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:44,566
But we have the white wizard.
That's got to count for something.

556
00:54:50,454 --> 00:54:52,035
(Gandalf?

557
00:54:55,751 --> 00:54:59,414
Gandalf: Sauron has yet to reveal
his deadliest servant.

558
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:03,714
The one who will lead
mordor's armies in war.

559
00:55:03,884 --> 00:55:09,049
The one they say no living man can kill.

560
00:55:10,057 --> 00:55:12,218
The witch-king of angmar.

561
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:15,676
You've met him before.

562
00:55:16,355 --> 00:55:18,937
He stabbed Frodo on weathertop.

563
00:55:25,489 --> 00:55:28,196
He is the lord of the nazgul...

564
00:55:28,659 --> 00:55:31,116
The greatest of the nine.

565
00:55:31,286 --> 00:55:34,824
Minas morgul is his lair.

566
00:55:38,377 --> 00:55:41,915
Gollum: The dead city.

567
00:55:42,089 --> 00:55:47,300
Very nasty place. Full of enemies.

568
00:55:54,518 --> 00:55:56,679
Quick. Quick.

569
00:55:56,854 --> 00:56:00,847
They will see. They will see.

570
00:56:10,117 --> 00:56:15,407
Come away. Come away.
Look, we have found it.

571
00:56:15,581 --> 00:56:19,449
The way into mordor.

572
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:23,960
The secret stair.

573
00:56:24,381 --> 00:56:26,747
Climb.

574
00:56:47,029 --> 00:56:49,771
- No, Mr. Frodo!
- Not that way!

575
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:57,487
Gollum: What's it doing? - No.

576
00:56:57,664 --> 00:57:00,747
- They're calling me.
Gollum: No.

577
00:57:30,405 --> 00:57:33,363
Gollum: Hide! Hide!

578
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:19,743
I can feel his blade.

579
00:58:31,425 --> 00:58:33,541
We come to it at last.

580
00:58:35,387 --> 00:58:38,254
The great battle of our time.

581
00:59:17,429 --> 00:59:20,671
Come away, hobbits.
We climb. We must climb.

582
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:33,559
The board is set.

583
00:59:33,737 --> 00:59:36,103
The pieces are moving.

584
00:59:38,825 --> 00:59:41,487
Up, up, up the stairs we go.

585
00:59:41,661 --> 00:59:44,323
And then it's into the tunnel

586
00:59:44,498 --> 00:59:47,706
hey, what's in this tunnel?

587
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:50,993
You listen to me,
and you listen good and proper.

588
00:59:51,171 --> 00:59:54,083
Anything happens to him,
you have me to answer to.

589
00:59:54,257 --> 00:59:55,838
One sniff something's not right...

590
00:59:56,009 --> 00:59:59,172
One hair stands up
on the back of my head, it's over.

591
00:59:59,387 --> 01:00:02,049
No more slinker. No more stinker.

592
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:05,006
You're gone. Got it?

593
01:00:05,894 --> 01:00:07,885
I'm watching you.

594
01:00:13,235 --> 01:00:15,226
What was that about?

595
01:00:15,403 --> 01:00:17,815
Nothing. Just clearing something up.

596
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:27,321
Peregrin took, my lad,
there is a task now to be done.

597
01:00:27,499 --> 01:00:32,084
Another opportunity for one of the
shire-folk to prove their great worth.

598
01:00:36,925 --> 01:00:38,506
You must not fail me.

599
01:01:12,752 --> 01:01:15,835
Madril:
It's been very quiet across the river.

600
01:01:16,006 --> 01:01:18,338
The orcs are lying low.

601
01:01:18,508 --> 01:01:20,499
The Garrison may have moved out.

602
01:01:21,636 --> 01:01:24,343
We've sent scouts to cair andros.

603
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:26,834
If the orcs attack from the north,
we'll have some warning.

604
01:01:53,126 --> 01:01:54,332
Quiet.

605
01:01:58,423 --> 01:02:00,379
Soldier: We need 10 more.

606
01:02:21,696 --> 01:02:23,232
Kill him!

607
01:02:40,548 --> 01:02:42,960
They're not coming from the north.

608
01:02:44,386 --> 01:02:48,720
- To the river. Quick. Quick.
- Go come on.

609
01:02:52,185 --> 01:02:53,766
Faster

610
01:03:06,908 --> 01:03:09,274
Draw swords.

611
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:06,422
Faramir: Hold! Hold them!

612
01:05:26,714 --> 01:05:28,579
What?

613
01:05:41,146 --> 01:05:42,556
Amon din.

614
01:05:48,361 --> 01:05:51,398
Guard: The beacon.
The beacon of amon din is lit.

615
01:05:54,659 --> 01:05:58,868
Hope is kindled.

616
01:07:31,256 --> 01:07:35,625
Aragorn: The beacons of minas tirith!
The beacons are lit!

617
01:07:36,844 --> 01:07:38,459
Ggondor calls for aid.

618
01:07:48,982 --> 01:07:51,894
And Rohan will answer.

619
01:07:52,318 --> 01:07:55,105
Muster the rohirrim.

620
01:08:10,211 --> 01:08:12,167
Assemble the army at dunharrow.

621
01:08:12,338 --> 01:08:16,707
As many men as can be found.
You have two days.

622
01:08:16,884 --> 01:08:22,174
On the third,
we ride for gondor and war.

623
01:08:22,682 --> 01:08:24,343
Man 1: Forward.
Man 2: Very good, sir.

624
01:08:24,517 --> 01:08:25,927
Gamling. Gamling: My lord.

625
01:08:26,102 --> 01:08:27,717
Make haste
across the riddermark.

626
01:08:27,895 --> 01:08:30,011
Summon every able-bodied man
to dunharrow.

627
01:08:30,189 --> 01:08:31,770
Gamling: I will

628
01:08:35,862 --> 01:08:39,025
- will you ride with us?
- Just to the encampment.

629
01:08:39,198 --> 01:08:43,111
It's tradition for the women
of the court to farewell the men.

630
01:08:49,667 --> 01:08:51,578
The men have found their captain.

631
01:08:51,753 --> 01:08:55,086
They will follow you into battle,
even to death.

632
01:08:55,256 --> 01:08:56,837
You have given us hope.

633
01:09:00,053 --> 01:09:02,009
Merry: Excuse me.

634
01:09:03,348 --> 01:09:04,838
I have a sword.

635
01:09:05,141 --> 01:09:06,506
Please accept it.

636
01:09:07,644 --> 01:09:12,138
I offer you my service, theoden king.

637
01:09:15,568 --> 01:09:17,650
And gladly I accept it.

638
01:09:18,738 --> 01:09:22,822
You shall be meriadoc,
esquire of Rohan.

639
01:09:27,705 --> 01:09:28,911
Horse-men.

640
01:09:29,582 --> 01:09:35,202
I wish I could muster a legion of dwarves,
fully armed and filthy.

641
01:09:35,588 --> 01:09:38,546
Your kinsmen may have no need
to ride to war.

642
01:09:38,716 --> 01:09:42,129
I fear war already marches
on their own lands.

643
01:10:00,613 --> 01:10:04,071
Theoden: So it is before the walls
of minas tirith

644
01:10:04,242 --> 01:10:08,110
the doom of our time will be decided.

645
01:10:10,707 --> 01:10:16,247
Now is the hour.
Riders of Rohan, oaths you have taken.

646
01:10:16,421 --> 01:10:20,790
Now, fulfill them all.
To lord and land! Hyah!

647
01:11:03,050 --> 01:11:05,006
Faramir!

648
01:11:11,309 --> 01:11:15,018
We can't hold them. The city is lost.

649
01:11:15,605 --> 01:11:18,688
Tell the men to break cover.
We ride for minas tirith.

650
01:11:27,450 --> 01:11:29,691
Nazgul.

651
01:11:32,079 --> 01:11:34,536
Soldier 1: Take cover!

652
01:11:34,707 --> 01:11:37,244
Soldier 2: Nazgdl!

653
01:11:37,418 --> 01:11:41,081
Fall back fall back to minas tirith!

654
01:11:47,678 --> 01:11:49,543
Fall back!

655
01:11:56,604 --> 01:12:01,189
- Retreat! Retreat!
Soldier 3: Run for your lives!

656
01:12:25,424 --> 01:12:29,758
The age of men is over.

657
01:12:29,929 --> 01:12:35,549
The time of the orc has come.

658
01:12:37,937 --> 01:12:40,269
Soldier 1: Keep going.
Soldier 2: It's the nazqgdl.

659
01:12:41,899 --> 01:12:44,265
Soldier 1: Take cover, my lord!

660
01:12:44,569 --> 01:12:45,900
It's coming!

661
01:12:51,450 --> 01:12:54,817
Man: It's mithrandir.
- The white rider!

662
01:13:34,785 --> 01:13:36,150
Guard: Pull!

663
01:13:53,888 --> 01:13:56,300
Faramir: Mithrandir.

664
01:13:56,474 --> 01:13:58,214
They broke through our defenses.

665
01:14:01,687 --> 01:14:03,678
Battalions of orcs are crossing the river.

666
01:14:03,856 --> 01:14:05,847
Iorlas:
It is as the lord denethor predicted.

667
01:14:06,025 --> 01:14:10,564
- Long has he foreseen this doom.
- Foreseen and done nothing.

668
01:14:13,950 --> 01:14:16,362
Faramir?

669
01:14:18,287 --> 01:14:22,121
This is not the first halfling
to have crossed your path.

670
01:14:22,291 --> 01:14:24,498
No

671
01:14:25,836 --> 01:14:27,372
You've seen Frodo and Sam?

672
01:14:28,255 --> 01:14:31,668
- Where? When?
- In ithilien.

673
01:14:31,842 --> 01:14:33,924
Not two days ago.

674
01:14:34,387 --> 01:14:38,847
Gandalf, they're taking the road
to the morgul vale.

675
01:14:39,558 --> 01:14:42,174
And then the pass of cirith ungol.

676
01:14:44,397 --> 01:14:46,763
What does that mean?

677
01:14:46,941 --> 01:14:51,856
- What's wrong?
- Faramir, tell me everything.

678
01:14:52,029 --> 01:14:54,065
Tell me all you know.

679
01:14:55,241 --> 01:14:58,654
This is how you would serve your city?

680
01:14:58,828 --> 01:15:02,116
You would risk its utter ruin?

681
01:15:03,165 --> 01:15:04,746
I did what I judged to be right.

682
01:15:05,459 --> 01:15:08,451
What you judged to be right.

683
01:15:09,088 --> 01:15:14,958
You sent the ring of power into mordor
in the hands of a witless halfling.

684
01:15:18,931 --> 01:15:23,766
It should have been brought back
to the citadel to be kept safe.

685
01:15:25,396 --> 01:15:26,932
Hidden.

686
01:15:27,356 --> 01:15:30,098
Dark and deep in the vaults...

687
01:15:30,276 --> 01:15:32,437
Not to be used.

688
01:15:36,615 --> 01:15:41,484
Unless at the uttermost end of need.

689
01:15:41,954 --> 01:15:43,990
I would not use the ring.

690
01:15:44,165 --> 01:15:47,248
Not if minas tirith were falling in ruin
and I alone could save her.

691
01:15:47,585 --> 01:15:52,420
Ever you desire to appear lordly
and gracious...

692
01:15:52,590 --> 01:15:54,831
As a king of old.

693
01:15:56,635 --> 01:16:00,378
Boromir would have remembered
his father's need.

694
01:16:00,806 --> 01:16:03,263
He would have brought me a kingly gift.

695
01:16:03,476 --> 01:16:06,013
Boromir would not
have brought the ring.

696
01:16:06,437 --> 01:16:09,708
He would have stretched out his hand to this
thing and taken it. He would've fallen.

697
01:16:09,732 --> 01:16:12,532
- You know nothing of this matter!
- He would have kept it for his own.

698
01:16:13,861 --> 01:16:16,022
And when he returned.

699
01:16:17,156 --> 01:16:18,817
You would not have known your son.

700
01:16:18,991 --> 01:16:21,528
Boromir was loyal to me!

701
01:16:21,702 --> 01:16:24,284
Not some wizard's pupil!

702
01:16:32,421 --> 01:16:33,752
Father?

703
01:16:46,435 --> 01:16:48,346
My son.

704
01:17:14,588 --> 01:17:15,953
I eave me.

705
01:17:49,540 --> 01:17:52,077
Gollum:
Careful, master. Careful.

706
01:17:52,418 --> 01:17:55,330
Very far to fall.

707
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:01,753
Very dangerous are the stairs.

708
01:18:04,430 --> 01:18:06,967
Come, master.

709
01:18:12,771 --> 01:18:15,934
Come to smeagol.

710
01:18:22,281 --> 01:18:23,771
Sam: Mr. Frodo.

711
01:18:24,783 --> 01:18:26,319
Get back, you!

712
01:18:26,493 --> 01:18:28,700
Don't touch him!

713
01:18:32,833 --> 01:18:35,666
Why does he hates poor smeagol?

714
01:18:35,836 --> 01:18:39,545
What has smeagol ever done to him?

715
01:18:39,715 --> 01:18:41,046
Master?

716
01:18:42,885 --> 01:18:46,343
Master carries heavy burden.

717
01:18:46,513 --> 01:18:51,928
Smeagol knows.
Heavy, heavy burden.

718
01:18:52,102 --> 01:18:55,344
Fat one cannot know.

719
01:18:57,399 --> 01:19:00,141
Smeéagol look after master.

720
01:19:01,362 --> 01:19:03,569
He wants it.

721
01:19:03,739 --> 01:19:08,278
He needs it.
Sméagol sees it in his eye.

722
01:19:08,452 --> 01:19:13,913
Very soon he will ask you for it.
You will see.

723
01:19:14,083 --> 01:19:17,951
The fat one will take it from you.

724
01:19:25,177 --> 01:19:29,511
Witch-king:
Send forth all legions.

725
01:19:29,682 --> 01:19:33,721
Do not stop the attack
until the city is taken.

726
01:19:34,436 --> 01:19:37,553
Slay them all.

727
01:19:39,233 --> 01:19:45,024
- What of the wizard?
Witch-king: I will break him.

728
01:19:48,367 --> 01:19:50,779
Guard:
Where are théoden's riders?

729
01:19:50,953 --> 01:19:53,535
Will Rohan's army come?

730
01:19:53,706 --> 01:19:55,947
Mithrandir.

731
01:19:57,001 --> 01:20:00,869
Courage is the best defense
that you have now.

732
01:20:05,676 --> 01:20:08,383
Pippin:
What were you thinking, peregrin took?

733
01:20:10,472 --> 01:20:16,183
What service can a hobbit
offer such a great lord of men?

734
01:20:16,353 --> 01:20:17,843
Faramir: It was well-done.

735
01:20:21,025 --> 01:20:25,064
A generous deed should not
be checked with cold counsel

736
01:20:25,821 --> 01:20:28,358
you are to join the tower guard.

737
01:20:28,907 --> 01:20:31,899
I didn't think they would find any livery
that would fit me.

738
01:20:32,077 --> 01:20:34,534
Once belonged to a young boy
of the city.

739
01:20:34,705 --> 01:20:36,241
A very foolish one...

740
01:20:36,415 --> 01:20:40,658
Who wasted many hours slaying dragons
instead of attending to his studies.

741
01:20:40,836 --> 01:20:43,578
- This was yours?
- Yes, it was mine.

742
01:20:43,756 --> 01:20:45,542
My father had it made for me.

743
01:20:46,592 --> 01:20:47,923
Well

744
01:20:48,093 --> 01:20:50,084
I'm taller than you were then.

745
01:20:50,262 --> 01:20:53,595
Though I'm not likely to grow anymore,
except sideways.

746
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:58,596
Never fitted me either.

747
01:20:58,771 --> 01:21:01,604
Boromir was always the soldier.

748
01:21:04,610 --> 01:21:07,022
They were so alike, he and my father.

749
01:21:09,114 --> 01:21:10,729
Proud.

750
01:21:10,908 --> 01:21:12,114
Stubborn even.

751
01:21:13,869 --> 01:21:15,359
But strong.

752
01:21:16,872 --> 01:21:20,035
I think you have strength
of a different kind.

753
01:21:20,667 --> 01:21:23,124
And one day your father will see it.

754
01:21:27,299 --> 01:21:31,087
Pippin: Here do I swear fealty
and service to gondor.

755
01:21:31,261 --> 01:21:32,751
In peace or war...

756
01:21:33,389 --> 01:21:35,846
In living or dying...

757
01:21:37,226 --> 01:21:38,466
From.

758
01:21:41,146 --> 01:21:43,933
From this hour henceforth

759
01:21:44,108 --> 01:21:46,019
until my lord release me...

760
01:21:47,528 --> 01:21:49,735
Or death take me.

761
01:21:50,322 --> 01:21:52,813
And I shall not forget it...

762
01:21:52,991 --> 01:21:56,358
Nor fail to reward
that which is given.

763
01:22:03,961 --> 01:22:06,247
Fealty with love.

764
01:22:07,339 --> 01:22:09,000
Valor with honor.

765
01:22:10,592 --> 01:22:13,925
Disloyalty with vengeance.

766
01:22:22,563 --> 01:22:26,647
I do not think we should so lightly
abandon the outer defenses

767
01:22:26,817 --> 01:22:29,559
defenses that your brother
long held intact.

768
01:22:29,736 --> 01:22:32,227
- What would you have me do?
- I will not yield...

769
01:22:32,406 --> 01:22:35,193
The river in pelennor unfought.

770
01:22:35,367 --> 01:22:37,028
Osgiliath must be retaken.

771
01:22:37,202 --> 01:22:39,238
My lord, osgiliath is overrun.

772
01:22:39,913 --> 01:22:42,700
Much must be risked in war.

773
01:22:45,335 --> 01:22:49,294
Is there a captain here who still has
the courage to do his lord's will?

774
01:22:55,512 --> 01:22:58,754
You wish now that our places
had been exchanged...

775
01:22:59,725 --> 01:23:02,558
That I had died
and Boromir had lived.

776
01:23:05,981 --> 01:23:07,721
Yes

777
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:10,607
I wish that

778
01:23:18,994 --> 01:23:21,485
Since you were robbed
of Boromir.

779
01:23:23,332 --> 01:23:26,244
I will do what I can
in his stead.

780
01:23:34,426 --> 01:23:38,886
If I should return,
think better of me, father.

781
01:23:40,974 --> 01:23:44,592
That will depend on the manner
of your return.

782
01:24:44,037 --> 01:24:45,868
Ugh.

783
01:25:07,894 --> 01:25:10,226
Sam: What are you up to?

784
01:25:10,397 --> 01:25:11,637
Sneaking off, are we”?

785
01:25:12,357 --> 01:25:14,188
Sneaking?

786
01:25:15,193 --> 01:25:17,354
Sneaking?

787
01:25:18,780 --> 01:25:21,943
Fat hobbit is always so polite.

788
01:25:22,117 --> 01:25:27,202
Smeagol shows them secret ways
that nobody else could find...

789
01:25:27,372 --> 01:25:29,533
And they say "sneak."

790
01:25:30,167 --> 01:25:32,749
Sneak?

791
01:25:33,378 --> 01:25:36,085
Very nice friend.
Oh, yes, my precious.

792
01:25:36,256 --> 01:25:38,872
- Very nice, very nice.
- All right. All right!

793
01:25:40,135 --> 01:25:42,342
You just startled me is all.

794
01:25:42,846 --> 01:25:44,677
What were you doing?

795
01:25:46,308 --> 01:25:48,424
Sneaking.

796
01:25:48,810 --> 01:25:51,893
Fine. Have it your own way.

797
01:25:54,149 --> 01:25:56,640
I'm sorry to wake you, Mr. Frodo.

798
01:25:57,027 --> 01:25:58,983
We have to be moving on.

799
01:26:04,159 --> 01:26:05,740
It's dark still

800
01:26:05,911 --> 01:26:08,118
it's always dark here.

801
01:26:12,376 --> 01:26:14,287
It's gone!

802
01:26:15,504 --> 01:26:18,371
The elven bread. “What?

803
01:26:18,548 --> 01:26:20,004
That's all we have left.

804
01:26:24,096 --> 01:26:26,587
He took it. He must have!

805
01:26:27,099 --> 01:26:30,341
Smeagol?
No, no, not poor sméagol.

806
01:26:30,519 --> 01:26:33,431
Smeéagol hates nasty elf bread.

807
01:26:33,605 --> 01:26:36,768
You're a lying rat!
What did you do with it?!

808
01:26:39,486 --> 01:26:41,818
- He can't have taken it.
Gollum: Look.

809
01:26:42,864 --> 01:26:44,695
What's this?

810
01:26:47,369 --> 01:26:50,702
Crumbs on his jacketses.
He took it!

811
01:26:51,415 --> 01:26:53,076
He took it.

812
01:26:53,917 --> 01:26:58,126
I seen him. He's always stuffing
his face when master's not looking.

813
01:26:58,296 --> 01:27:00,082
That's a filthy lie!

814
01:27:00,257 --> 01:27:02,464
You stinking, two-faced sneak!

815
01:27:02,634 --> 01:27:03,874
Sam! Sam: Call me...

816
01:27:04,052 --> 01:27:05,292
Frodo: Stop it!

817
01:27:06,930 --> 01:27:08,636
Sam!

818
01:27:08,807 --> 01:27:12,425
I'll kill him! Sam! No!

819
01:27:13,478 --> 01:27:19,018
Oh, my... I'm sorry. I didn't mean it
to go so far. I was just so... so angry.

820
01:27:19,192 --> 01:27:21,308
Here, just...
Let's just rest a bit.

821
01:27:21,486 --> 01:27:23,568
- I'm all right.
- No.

822
01:27:23,739 --> 01:27:26,822
No, you're not all right.
You're exhausted

823
01:27:26,992 --> 01:27:29,108
it's that gollum.

824
01:27:29,286 --> 01:27:30,992
It's this place.

825
01:27:31,163 --> 01:27:33,745
It's that thing around your neck.

826
01:27:37,252 --> 01:27:38,537
I could help a bit.

827
01:27:38,712 --> 01:27:41,374
I could carry it for a while.

828
01:27:41,548 --> 01:27:43,288
Carry it for a while.

829
01:27:43,467 --> 01:27:44,947
I could carry it... l could carry it.

830
01:27:45,343 --> 01:27:50,804
Share the load... share the load...
The load the load.

831
01:27:50,974 --> 01:27:52,180
Get away!

832
01:27:52,350 --> 01:27:53,990
I don't want to keep it.

833
01:27:57,522 --> 01:27:59,513
I just want to help.

834
01:28:01,568 --> 01:28:04,184
See? See?

835
01:28:04,362 --> 01:28:07,775
He wants it for himself.

836
01:28:07,949 --> 01:28:09,655
Shut up, you!

837
01:28:10,202 --> 01:28:12,033
Go away! Get out of here!

838
01:28:12,204 --> 01:28:14,035
Frodo: No, Sam.

839
01:28:14,206 --> 01:28:15,446
It's you.

840
01:28:19,669 --> 01:28:21,375
I'm sorry, Sam.

841
01:28:23,048 --> 01:28:24,413
But he's a liar.

842
01:28:24,591 --> 01:28:27,253
He's poisoned you against me.

843
01:28:28,678 --> 01:28:30,589
You can't help me anymore.

844
01:28:32,557 --> 01:28:34,422
You don't mean that.

845
01:28:36,937 --> 01:28:38,723
(Go home.

846
01:29:58,768 --> 01:30:00,554
Gandalf: Faramir!

847
01:30:00,729 --> 01:30:02,640
Faramir!

848
01:30:04,149 --> 01:30:06,185
Your father's will has turned
to madness.

849
01:30:07,360 --> 01:30:09,396
Do not throw away your life
so rashly.

850
01:30:10,155 --> 01:30:12,487
Where does my allegiance lie
if not here?

851
01:30:13,116 --> 01:30:16,028
This is the city of the men of numenor.

852
01:30:16,661 --> 01:30:19,448
I will gladly give my life
to defend her beauty...

853
01:30:19,623 --> 01:30:22,831
Ner memory, her wisdom.

854
01:30:25,211 --> 01:30:28,624
Your father loves you, faramir.

855
01:30:29,341 --> 01:30:32,333
He will remember it
before the end.

856
01:31:41,955 --> 01:31:43,491
Can you sing, master hobbit?

857
01:31:46,376 --> 01:31:47,866
Well

858
01:31:48,420 --> 01:31:50,035
yes.

859
01:31:50,755 --> 01:31:54,498
At least, well enough
for my own people.

860
01:31:56,136 --> 01:31:58,548
But we have no songs
for great halls...

861
01:31:59,597 --> 01:32:00,837
And evil times.

862
01:32:01,683 --> 01:32:04,846
And why should your songs
be unfit for my halls?

863
01:32:07,647 --> 01:32:09,057
Come, sing me a song.

864
01:32:20,118 --> 01:32:23,451
Home is behind

865
01:32:23,621 --> 01:32:27,364
the world ahead

866
01:32:29,794 --> 01:32:35,630
and there are many paths to tread

867
01:32:37,427 --> 01:32:40,965
through shadow

868
01:32:41,139 --> 01:32:45,303
to the edge of night

869
01:32:46,978 --> 01:32:52,063
until the stars are all alight

870
01:32:55,070 --> 01:32:59,404
mist and shadow

871
01:32:59,574 --> 01:33:03,863
cloud and shade

872
01:33:06,247 --> 01:33:09,580
all shall fade

873
01:33:11,961 --> 01:33:15,954
all shall

874
01:33:21,721 --> 01:33:24,087
Fade

875
01:33:48,498 --> 01:33:51,956
Lead orc: March! March!

876
01:33:52,127 --> 01:33:57,247
March! March! March!

877
01:34:00,802 --> 01:34:03,134
Man 1: Make way for the king.

878
01:34:04,639 --> 01:34:06,630
Make way.

879
01:34:09,102 --> 01:34:11,138
Man 2: The king is here.

880
01:34:13,106 --> 01:34:14,721
Man 3: My lord.

881
01:34:15,984 --> 01:34:17,940
Man 4: Hail to you, sire.

882
01:34:18,403 --> 01:34:19,609
Grimbold, how many?

883
01:34:19,779 --> 01:34:22,236
I bring 500 men from the westfold,
my lord.

884
01:34:23,199 --> 01:34:25,861
Fenmarch man: We have 300 more
from fenmarch, théoden king.

885
01:34:26,995 --> 01:34:30,954
- Where are the riders from snowbourn?
Gamling: None have come, my lord.

886
01:34:48,016 --> 01:34:50,132
Theoden: Six thousand Spears.

887
01:34:51,186 --> 01:34:53,177
Less than half of what I'd hoped for.

888
01:34:53,479 --> 01:34:56,846
Six thousand will not be enough
to break the lines of mordor.

889
01:34:59,611 --> 01:35:01,351
More will come.

890
01:35:01,738 --> 01:35:04,696
Every hour lost hastens gondor's defeat.

891
01:35:04,866 --> 01:35:07,448
We have till dawn,
then we must ride.

892
01:35:26,930 --> 01:35:29,262
The horses are restless

893
01:35:29,432 --> 01:35:30,922
and the men are quiet.

894
01:35:31,392 --> 01:35:34,509
They grow nervous in the shadow
of the mountain.

895
01:35:36,981 --> 01:35:38,846
Gimli: That road there

896
01:35:39,776 --> 01:35:41,858
where does that lead?

897
01:35:42,612 --> 01:35:46,446
It is the road to the dimholt,
the door under the mountain.

898
01:35:47,158 --> 01:35:50,150
None who venture there ever return.

899
01:35:51,371 --> 01:35:53,236
That mountain is evil

900
01:36:04,592 --> 01:36:06,674
Man: Hold!

901
01:36:16,187 --> 01:36:18,018
Gimli: Aragorn.

902
01:36:18,773 --> 01:36:20,684
I et's find some food.

903
01:36:37,208 --> 01:36:38,618
There.

904
01:36:39,544 --> 01:36:42,536
A true esquire of Rohan.

905
01:36:46,217 --> 01:36:47,878
I'm ready.

906
01:36:49,804 --> 01:36:51,044
Sorry.

907
01:36:51,222 --> 01:36:53,508
It isn't all that dangerous.

908
01:36:54,017 --> 01:36:56,349
It's not even sharp.

909
01:36:57,020 --> 01:37:00,387
Well, that's no good. You won't kill
many orcs with a blunt blade.

910
01:37:00,565 --> 01:37:02,055
Come on.

911
01:37:06,237 --> 01:37:08,728
To the smithy. Go!

912
01:37:10,241 --> 01:37:12,732
You should not encourage him.

913
01:37:12,952 --> 01:37:15,409
You should not doubt him.

914
01:37:15,580 --> 01:37:18,868
I do not doubt his heart,
only the reach of his arm.

915
01:37:21,586 --> 01:37:23,167
Why should merry be left behind?

916
01:37:23,338 --> 01:37:25,954
He has as much cause
to go to war as you.

917
01:37:28,092 --> 01:37:31,255
Why can he not fight
for those he loves?

918
01:37:34,557 --> 01:37:37,549
You know as little of war
as that hobbit.

919
01:37:38,770 --> 01:37:40,886
When the fear takes him.

920
01:37:41,064 --> 01:37:46,104
And the blood and the screams
and the horror of battle take hold.

921
01:37:46,486 --> 01:37:48,602
Do you think he would stand and fight?

922
01:37:51,199 --> 01:37:52,780
He would flee.

923
01:37:52,992 --> 01:37:55,028
And he would be right to do so.

924
01:37:57,246 --> 01:38:01,205
War is the province of men, eowyn.

925
01:38:36,828 --> 01:38:40,571
Arwen: I choose a mortal life.

926
01:38:43,501 --> 01:38:46,334
I wish I could've seen him...

927
01:38:47,505 --> 01:38:50,167
One last time.

928
01:39:01,352 --> 01:39:02,808
Man: Sir?

929
01:39:04,647 --> 01:39:07,184
King theoden awaits you, my lord.

930
01:39:28,004 --> 01:39:29,960
I take my leave.

931
01:39:44,604 --> 01:39:45,844
My lord elrond.

932
01:39:46,397 --> 01:39:49,889
I come on behalf of one whom I love.

933
01:39:53,029 --> 01:39:55,020
Arwen is dying.

934
01:39:59,827 --> 01:40:03,866
She will not long survive the evil
that now spreads from mordor.

935
01:40:04,624 --> 01:40:07,991
The light of the evenstar is failing.

936
01:40:08,169 --> 01:40:12,162
As Sauron's power grows,
her strength wanes.

937
01:40:12,340 --> 01:40:16,083
Arwen's life is now tied
to the fate of the ring.

938
01:40:16,844 --> 01:40:19,426
The shadow is upon us, aragorn.

939
01:40:19,764 --> 01:40:21,425
The end has come.

940
01:40:21,849 --> 01:40:24,431
It will not be our end, but his.

941
01:40:25,228 --> 01:40:28,766
You ride to war, but not to victory.

942
01:40:29,774 --> 01:40:33,437
Sauron's armies march on minas tirith,
this you know.

943
01:40:33,653 --> 01:40:38,067
But in secret he sends another force
which will attack from the river.

944
01:40:38,533 --> 01:40:41,946
A fleet of corsair ships sails
from the south

945
01:40:42,578 --> 01:40:44,660
they'll be in the city in two days.

946
01:40:45,164 --> 01:40:47,951
You're outnumbered, aragorn.

947
01:40:48,709 --> 01:40:50,791
You heed more men.

948
01:40:51,212 --> 01:40:52,952
There are none.

949
01:40:54,715 --> 01:40:58,628
There are those who dwell
in the mountain.

950
01:41:07,645 --> 01:41:09,806
Murderers

951
01:41:09,981 --> 01:41:11,391
traitors.

952
01:41:13,818 --> 01:41:15,979
You would call upon them to fight?

953
01:41:16,195 --> 01:41:17,776
They believe in nothing.

954
01:41:17,947 --> 01:41:20,063
They answer to no one.

955
01:41:20,241 --> 01:41:23,324
They will answer
to the king of gondor.

956
01:41:30,459 --> 01:41:35,579
Anduril, the flame of the west,
forged from the shards of narsil.

957
01:41:49,854 --> 01:41:54,314
Sauron will not have forgotten
the sword of elendil

958
01:42:08,372 --> 01:42:13,116
The blade that was broken
shall return to minas tirith_

959
01:42:13,294 --> 01:42:15,706
The man who can wield
the power of this sword...

960
01:42:15,880 --> 01:42:19,748
Can summon to him an army more
deadly than any that walks this earth.

961
01:42:21,552 --> 01:42:23,713
Put aside the ranger.

962
01:42:23,888 --> 01:42:27,221
Become who you were born to be.

963
01:42:27,391 --> 01:42:29,382
Take the dimholt road.

964
01:42:55,419 --> 01:42:57,080
Why are you doing this?

965
01:42:57,588 --> 01:43:00,796
The war lies to the east.
You cannot leave on the Eve of battle.

966
01:43:03,219 --> 01:43:05,301
You cannot abandon the men.

967
01:43:06,597 --> 01:43:08,178
Eowyn...

968
01:43:08,349 --> 01:43:10,556
We need you here.

969
01:43:11,686 --> 01:43:13,551
Why have you come?

970
01:43:15,231 --> 01:43:17,187
Do you not know?

971
01:43:26,450 --> 01:43:29,442
It is but a shadow and a thought
that you love.

972
01:43:33,416 --> 01:43:35,828
I cannot give you what you seek.

973
01:43:49,348 --> 01:43:53,261
I have wished you joy
since first I saw you.

974
01:44:12,413 --> 01:44:14,654
Gimli:
Just where do you think you're off to?

975
01:44:14,874 --> 01:44:16,159
Not this time.

976
01:44:16,375 --> 01:44:18,582
- This time you must stay, gimli.
- Mm_

977
01:44:21,297 --> 01:44:24,130
Have you learned nothing
of the stubbornness of dwarves?

978
01:44:24,300 --> 01:44:27,963
You might as well accept it.
We're going with you, laddie.

979
01:44:50,284 --> 01:44:52,445
Man 1: What's happening?
- Where is he going?

980
01:44:52,787 --> 01:44:54,652
Where's he going?

981
01:44:57,208 --> 01:44:59,290
I don't understand.

982
01:45:03,714 --> 01:45:05,500
Man 2: Lord aragorn!

983
01:45:05,925 --> 01:45:08,632
Man 1:
Why does he leave on the Eve of battle?

984
01:45:09,845 --> 01:45:11,927
He leaves because there is no hope.

985
01:45:12,556 --> 01:45:14,717
He leaves because he must.

986
01:45:14,892 --> 01:45:16,553
Gamling: Too few have come.

987
01:45:16,727 --> 01:45:18,934
We cannot defeat
the armies of mordor.

988
01:45:21,440 --> 01:45:23,055
No

989
01:45:23,526 --> 01:45:24,732
We cannot.

990
01:45:45,881 --> 01:45:47,587
I have left instruction.

991
01:45:50,261 --> 01:45:53,549
The people are to follow
your rule in my stead.

992
01:46:00,104 --> 01:46:02,390
Take up my seat in the golden hall.

993
01:46:03,607 --> 01:46:06,440
Long may you defend edoras...

994
01:46:06,610 --> 01:46:08,976
If the battle goes lll.

995
01:46:10,072 --> 01:46:13,485
What other duty would you
have me do, my lord?

996
01:46:15,703 --> 01:46:17,614
Duty?

997
01:46:19,790 --> 01:46:21,121
No

998
01:46:29,466 --> 01:46:31,582
I would have you smile again...

999
01:46:35,014 --> 01:46:40,008
Not grieve for those
whose time has come.

1000
01:46:44,815 --> 01:46:48,307
You shall live to see
these days renewed...

1001
01:46:52,656 --> 01:46:55,443
And no more despair.

1002
01:47:01,665 --> 01:47:05,328
Gimli: What kind of army would linger
in such a place?

1003
01:47:05,544 --> 01:47:07,330
Legolas: One that is cursed.

1004
01:47:09,340 --> 01:47:11,831
Long ago, the men of the mountains
swore an oath

1005
01:47:12,301 --> 01:47:15,043
to the last king of gondor...

1006
01:47:15,638 --> 01:47:17,174
To come to his aid

1007
01:47:17,348 --> 01:47:19,088
to fight.

1008
01:47:19,600 --> 01:47:21,761
But when the time came

1009
01:47:22,353 --> 01:47:25,015
when gondor's need was dire

1010
01:47:25,189 --> 01:47:27,020
they fled...

1011
01:47:27,191 --> 01:47:30,604
Vanishing into the darkness
of the mountain.

1012
01:47:31,654 --> 01:47:33,986
And so isildur cursed them.

1013
01:47:35,532 --> 01:47:39,366
Never to rest until they had
fulfilled their pledge.

1014
01:47:43,707 --> 01:47:46,870
Who shall call them
from the grey twilight?

1015
01:47:47,336 --> 01:47:49,543
The forgotten people.

1016
01:47:49,713 --> 01:47:52,204
The heir of him to whom
the oath they swore.

1017
01:47:52,716 --> 01:47:54,581
From the north shall he come.

1018
01:47:55,094 --> 01:47:56,709
Need shall drive him.

1019
01:47:57,846 --> 01:48:01,338
He shall pass the door
to the paths of the dead.

1020
01:48:19,827 --> 01:48:23,115
The very warmth of my blood
seems stolen away.

1021
01:48:28,669 --> 01:48:30,625
The way is shut.

1022
01:48:31,380 --> 01:48:33,336
It was made by those
who are dead.

1023
01:48:33,924 --> 01:48:36,210
And the dead keep it.

1024
01:48:36,760 --> 01:48:38,250
The way is shut.

1025
01:48:49,648 --> 01:48:51,138
Brego!

1026
01:48:54,653 --> 01:48:57,360
I do not fear death.

1027
01:49:09,668 --> 01:49:12,080
Well, this is a thing unheard-of.

1028
01:49:12,254 --> 01:49:16,918
An elf will go underground
where a dwarf dare not?

1029
01:49:17,092 --> 01:49:18,423
Oh.

1030
01:49:18,594 --> 01:49:21,427
Oh, I'd never hear the end of it.

1031
01:49:36,445 --> 01:49:38,652
We must ride light and swift.

1032
01:49:38,822 --> 01:49:40,608
It is a long road ahead.

1033
01:49:40,783 --> 01:49:43,820
And man and beast must reach the end
with the strength to fight.

1034
01:49:49,333 --> 01:49:52,325
Little hobbits do not belong in war,
master meriadoc.

1035
01:49:52,711 --> 01:49:54,667
All my friends have gone to battle.

1036
01:49:54,838 --> 01:49:56,749
I would be ashamed to be left behind.

1037
01:49:56,924 --> 01:49:59,006
It is a three-day gallop to minas tirith.

1038
01:49:59,218 --> 01:50:01,584
And none of my riders can bear you
as a burden.

1039
01:50:02,596 --> 01:50:04,712
I want to fight.

1040
01:50:05,224 --> 01:50:07,215
I will say no more.

1041
01:50:24,034 --> 01:50:25,990
Ride with me.

1042
01:50:27,454 --> 01:50:28,864
My lady.

1043
01:50:29,039 --> 01:50:31,371
Eomer: Form up! Move out!

1044
01:50:31,542 --> 01:50:34,784
Form up! Move out!

1045
01:50:37,881 --> 01:50:39,041
Theoden: Ride!

1046
01:50:39,258 --> 01:50:42,216
Ride now to gondor!

1047
01:51:23,844 --> 01:51:25,584
Gimli: What is it?

1048
01:51:25,762 --> 01:51:27,298
What do you see?

1049
01:51:27,556 --> 01:51:29,672
I see shapes of men.

1050
01:51:32,352 --> 01:51:33,717
And of horses.

1051
01:51:34,438 --> 01:51:35,678
Where?

1052
01:51:35,856 --> 01:51:38,814
Legolas:
Pale banners like shreds of cloud.

1053
01:51:41,236 --> 01:51:43,443
Spears rise...

1054
01:51:44,072 --> 01:51:47,530
Like winter-thickets
through a shroud of mist.

1055
01:51:48,785 --> 01:51:50,946
The dead are following.

1056
01:51:52,122 --> 01:51:53,612
They have been summoned.

1057
01:51:54,333 --> 01:51:56,119
The dead?

1058
01:51:56,543 --> 01:51:58,249
Summoned?

1059
01:51:58,629 --> 01:52:00,540
I knew that.

1060
01:52:01,089 --> 01:52:03,250
Huh ha.

1061
01:52:03,884 --> 01:52:05,624
Very good.

1062
01:52:06,345 --> 01:52:08,427
Very good! Legolas!

1063
01:52:46,385 --> 01:52:47,795
Do not look down.

1064
01:53:40,397 --> 01:53:45,517
King of the dead:
Who enters my domain?

1065
01:53:49,239 --> 01:53:51,480
One who will have your allegiance.

1066
01:53:54,453 --> 01:53:59,743
The dead do not suffer the living to pass.

1067
01:54:00,083 --> 01:54:02,745
You will suffer me.

1068
01:54:26,276 --> 01:54:29,689
King of the dead:
The way is shut.

1069
01:54:30,864 --> 01:54:35,278
It was made by those who are dead.

1070
01:54:35,702 --> 01:54:39,866
And the dead keep it.

1071
01:54:49,007 --> 01:54:52,090
The way is shut.

1072
01:54:53,804 --> 01:54:56,466
Now you must die.

1073
01:55:00,310 --> 01:55:03,143
I summon you to fulfill your oath.

1074
01:55:03,522 --> 01:55:08,482
None but the king of gondor
may command me.

1075
01:55:14,074 --> 01:55:16,235
That line was broken.

1076
01:55:18,829 --> 01:55:21,070
It has been remade.

1077
01:55:29,005 --> 01:55:30,495
Fight for us...

1078
01:55:30,674 --> 01:55:33,256
And regain your honor.

1079
01:55:37,431 --> 01:55:38,762
What say you?

1080
01:55:50,986 --> 01:55:52,522
What say you?

1081
01:55:52,696 --> 01:55:55,028
Ah! You waste your time, aragorn.

1082
01:55:55,198 --> 01:55:58,361
They had no honor in life,
they have none now in death.

1083
01:55:58,869 --> 01:56:01,360
I am isildur's heir.

1084
01:56:01,955 --> 01:56:03,866
Fight for me...

1085
01:56:04,499 --> 01:56:08,083
And I will hold your oaths fulfilled.

1086
01:56:12,007 --> 01:56:13,963
What say you?

1087
01:56:21,892 --> 01:56:24,099
You have my word!

1088
01:56:24,394 --> 01:56:28,387
Fight, and I will release you
from this living death!

1089
01:56:29,858 --> 01:56:31,348
What say you?!

1090
01:56:34,654 --> 01:56:37,612
Stand, you traitors!

1091
01:57:04,559 --> 01:57:05,594
Out!

1092
01:57:26,957 --> 01:57:28,538
Legolas!

1093
01:57:29,668 --> 01:57:30,874
Run!

1094
01:58:37,193 --> 01:58:39,229
We fight.

1095
01:58:49,623 --> 01:58:52,205
Iorlas: Open the gate! Quick!

1096
01:59:23,239 --> 01:59:25,230
Quick! Hurry!

1097
01:59:39,005 --> 01:59:40,586
Faramir!

1098
01:59:41,591 --> 01:59:44,879
Say not that he has fallen.

1099
01:59:46,054 --> 01:59:47,590
They were outnumbered.

1100
01:59:48,014 --> 01:59:49,595
None survived.

1101
01:59:50,308 --> 01:59:52,299
Fear

1102
01:59:52,852 --> 01:59:56,060
the city is rank with it.

1103
01:59:58,400 --> 02:00:00,857
Let us ease their pain.

1104
02:00:01,111 --> 02:00:02,851
Release the prisoners.

1105
02:00:03,029 --> 02:00:04,940
Catapults!

1106
02:00:08,243 --> 02:00:10,325
Man: Shields up!

1107
02:00:18,336 --> 02:00:21,794
Denethor: My sons are spent.

1108
02:00:22,841 --> 02:00:25,753
My line has ended.

1109
02:00:28,596 --> 02:00:29,961
Pippin: He's alive!

1110
02:00:30,140 --> 02:00:33,303
The house of stewards has failed.

1111
02:00:33,476 --> 02:00:34,966
He needs medicine, my lord.

1112
02:00:35,979 --> 02:00:38,641
My line has ended!

1113
02:00:40,150 --> 02:00:42,141
Pippin: My lord!

1114
02:00:49,159 --> 02:00:51,241
Orc: Put it in!

1115
02:00:55,665 --> 02:00:57,496
Rohan.

1116
02:00:58,293 --> 02:01:00,659
Has deserted us.

1117
02:01:15,143 --> 02:01:18,351
Theoden's betrayed me.

1118
02:01:29,491 --> 02:01:31,322
Abandon your posts!

1119
02:01:32,368 --> 02:01:36,281
Flee! Flee for your lives!

1120
02:01:38,792 --> 02:01:40,623
Oh!

1121
02:01:46,424 --> 02:01:47,960
Prepare for battle!

1122
02:01:48,510 --> 02:01:51,673
Hurry, men! To the wall! Defend the wall!

1123
02:01:52,847 --> 02:01:54,803
Man: Over here!

1124
02:01:55,558 --> 02:01:57,924
Gandalf: Return to your posts!

1125
02:02:08,738 --> 02:02:11,354
Send these foul beasts into the abyss.

1126
02:02:21,543 --> 02:02:22,999
Stay where you are.

1127
02:02:39,978 --> 02:02:41,388
Soldier 1: We need more rubble!

1128
02:02:41,563 --> 02:02:43,428
Soldier 2: Watch out!

1129
02:02:43,606 --> 02:02:46,097
Soldier 3:
Down to the lower levels. Quick!

1130
02:02:48,027 --> 02:02:49,563
Soldier 4: Double up, men!

1131
02:03:05,628 --> 02:03:07,084
Yah!

1132
02:03:58,556 --> 02:04:01,548
Hold them back! Do not give in to fear.

1133
02:04:02,060 --> 02:04:05,552
Stand to your posts! Fight!

1134
02:04:46,229 --> 02:04:47,844
Not at the towers!

1135
02:04:48,022 --> 02:04:51,014
Aim for the trolls! Kill the trolls!

1136
02:04:51,734 --> 02:04:53,599
Bring them down!

1137
02:05:28,730 --> 02:05:30,766
Fight them back!

1138
02:05:30,940 --> 02:05:32,931
Peregrin took!

1139
02:05:33,776 --> 02:05:36,939
- Go back to the citadel!
- They'd called us out to fight.

1140
02:05:52,670 --> 02:05:55,036
This is no place for a hobbit.

1141
02:06:20,782 --> 02:06:22,238
Guard of the citadel, indeed.

1142
02:06:22,825 --> 02:06:26,192
Now, back, up the hill. Quickly. Quick!

1143
02:06:37,507 --> 02:06:40,499
What are you doing,
you useless scum?!

1144
02:06:40,676 --> 02:06:42,632
The door won't give. It's too strong.

1145
02:06:48,976 --> 02:06:51,342
(Set back there and smash it down.

1146
02:06:51,521 --> 02:06:53,512
But nothing can breach it.

1147
02:06:56,484 --> 02:06:58,725
Ggrond will breach it.

1148
02:07:02,156 --> 02:07:04,238
Bring up the wolf's head.

1149
02:07:07,370 --> 02:07:12,740
Grond! Grond! Grond! Grond!

1150
02:07:13,042 --> 02:07:16,876
Grond! Grond! Grond!

1151
02:07:18,840 --> 02:07:22,253
Grond! Grond! Grond!

1152
02:07:22,969 --> 02:07:26,632
Grond! Grond! Grond!

1153
02:07:27,056 --> 02:07:35,012
Grond! Grond! Grond!
