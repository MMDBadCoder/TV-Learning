00:01:16.702 --> 00:01:20.445
Gandalf: You cannot pass!
Frodo: Gandalf!

2
00:01:25.294 --> 00:01:30.630
Gandalf: I am a servant of the secret fire.
wielder of the flame of anor.

3
00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:41.341
Go back to the shadow.

4
00:01:42.269 --> 00:01:46.057
The dark fire will not avail you.
flame of udiin!

5
00:01:49.901 --> 00:01:54.486
You shall not pass!

6
00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.386
Boromir: No! No!

7
00:02:23.477 --> 00:02:25.513
(Gandalf!

8
00:02:33.028 --> 00:02:34.768
Fly. you fools.

9
00:02:35.405 --> 00:02:37.270
No!

10
00:02:39.242 --> 00:02:41.324
(Gandalf!

11
00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.811
(Gandalf!

12
00:03:52.816 --> 00:03:55.102
What is it. Mr. Frodo?

13
00:03:56.987 --> 00:03:58.727
Nothing.

14
00:04:06.037 --> 00:04:08.119
Just a dream

15
00:04:21.261 --> 00:04:22.467
Can you see the bottom?

16
00:04:23.764 --> 00:04:26.881
No! Don't look down. Sam!
Just keep going!

17
00:04:37.694 --> 00:04:39.855
Catch it! Grab it. Mr. Frodo!

18
00:04:42.908 --> 00:04:44.899
Mr. Frodo!

19
00:04:47.496 --> 00:04:49.236
I think I've found the bottom.

20
00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:57.661
Sam: Bogs and rope.
and goodness knows what.

21
00:04:57.756 --> 00:05:01.044
It's not natural. None of it.

22
00:05:04.221 --> 00:05:06.303
- What's in this?
- Nothing.

23
00:05:07.682 --> 00:05:08.717
Just a bit of seasoning.

24
00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:12.176
I thought maybe if we was having
a roast chicken one night or something.

25
00:05:12.687 --> 00:05:14.848
Roast chicken?!

26
00:05:15.482 --> 00:05:16.722
You never know.

27
00:05:17.192 --> 00:05:20.184
Sam. My dear Sam.

28
00:05:21.822 --> 00:05:25.781
It's very special. that.
It's the best salt in all the shire.

29
00:05:27.035 --> 00:05:29.026
It is special.

30
00:05:32.916 --> 00:05:34.827
It's a little bit of home.

31
00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:40.541
We can't leave this here for someone
to follow us down.

32
00:05:41.007 --> 00:05:44.499
Who's gonna follow us down here.
Mr. Frodo?

33
00:05:45.345 --> 00:05:49.213
It's a shame. really.
Lady Galadriel gave me that.

34
00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:51.806
Real elvish rope.

35
00:05:52.727 --> 00:05:55.139
Well. there's nothing for it.
It's one of my knots.

36
00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:57.221
Won't come free in a hurry.

37
00:06:06.241 --> 00:06:08.323
Real elvish rope.

38
00:06:22.424 --> 00:06:26.963
Mordor. The one place in middle-earth
we don't want to see any closer.

39
00:06:27.053 --> 00:06:29.294
And it's the one place
we're trying to get to.

40
00:06:30.056 --> 00:06:31.796
It's just where we can't get.

41
00:06:33.268 --> 00:06:36.260
Let's face it. Mr. Frodo. we're lost.

42
00:06:38.565 --> 00:06:41.307
I don't think Gandalf meant for us to
come this way.

43
00:06:42.944 --> 00:06:46.277
He didn't mean for a lot of things
to happen. Sam...

44
00:06:47.073 --> 00:06:48.563
But they did.

45
00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:02.665
Mr Frodo?

46
00:07:06.593 --> 00:07:08.003
It's the ring. isn't it?

47
00:07:09.095 --> 00:07:11.586
It's getting heavier.

48
00:07:24.194 --> 00:07:26.936
- What food have we got left?
- I et me see.

49
00:07:27.656 --> 00:07:29.772
Oh. yes. Lovely.

50
00:07:29.866 --> 00:07:32.653
I embas bread. And look!

51
00:07:35.121 --> 00:07:37.362
More lembas bread.

52
00:07:48.134 --> 00:07:50.090
I don't usually hold with foreign food...

53
00:07:50.345 --> 00:07:53.257
But this elvish stuff. it's not bad.

54
00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:57.632
Nothing ever dampens your spirits.
does it. Sam?

55
00:08:03.483 --> 00:08:05.769
Those rain clouds might.

56
00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:42.807
Sam:
This looks strangely familiar.

57
00:08:43.398 --> 00:08:45.935
It's because we've been here before.

58
00:08:46.026 --> 00:08:48.642
We're going in circles.

59
00:08:49.404 --> 00:08:51.269
Sam: What is that horrid stink?

60
00:08:51.364 --> 00:08:53.650
I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby.

61
00:08:53.742 --> 00:08:55.698
Can you smell it? Yes

62
00:08:57.746 --> 00:08:59.987
I can smell it

63
00:09:03.251 --> 00:09:05.708
we're not alone.

64
00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:23.468
The thieves. The thieves.

65
00:09:23.563 --> 00:09:27.556
The filthy little thieves.

66
00:09:28.234 --> 00:09:33.270
Where is it?

67
00:09:33.948 --> 00:09:37.236
They stole it from us.

68
00:09:37.327 --> 00:09:41.570
My precious.

69
00:09:42.457 --> 00:09:45.745
Curse them. we hates them!

70
00:09:45.835 --> 00:09:49.953
It's ours. it is. and we wants it!

71
00:10:45.019 --> 00:10:46.884
This is sting.

72
00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:48.561
You've seen it before

73
00:10:48.648 --> 00:10:51.185
haven't you. gollum?

74
00:10:55.238 --> 00:10:58.730
Release him or I'll cut your throat.

75
00:11:14.799 --> 00:11:16.630
It burns!

76
00:11:16.718 --> 00:11:19.050
It burns us!

77
00:11:20.555 --> 00:11:22.011
It freezes!

78
00:11:23.808 --> 00:11:26.094
Nasty elves twisted it.

79
00:11:26.186 --> 00:11:28.893
- Take it off us!
- Quiet. you!

80
00:11:32.317 --> 00:11:36.606
It's hopeless. Every orc in mordor's
going to hear this racket.

81
00:11:36.696 --> 00:11:39.358
- Let's just tie him up and leave him.
- No!

82
00:11:39.616 --> 00:11:43.154
That would kill us! Kill us!

83
00:11:43.244 --> 00:11:45.986
It's no more than you deserve!

84
00:11:47.665 --> 00:11:49.701
Maybe he does deserve to die.

85
00:11:52.086 --> 00:11:55.578
But now that I see him. I do pity him.

86
00:11:59.010 --> 00:12:03.879
We be nice to them
if they be nice to us.

87
00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:06.882
Take it off us.

88
00:12:10.021 --> 00:12:13.980
We swears to do what you wants.

89
00:12:14.067 --> 00:12:16.058
We swears.

90
00:12:16.361 --> 00:12:18.773
There's no promise you can make
that I can trust.

91
00:12:21.449 --> 00:12:23.314
We swears

92
00:12:23.409 --> 00:12:28.199
to serve the master
of the precious.

93
00:12:29.832 --> 00:12:32.198
We will swear on.

94
00:12:32.293 --> 00:12:34.329
On the precious.

95
00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:36.706
Gollum. Gollum.

96
00:12:36.798 --> 00:12:40.962
The ring is treacherous.
It will hold you to your word.

97
00:12:41.803 --> 00:12:43.134
Yes

98
00:12:43.721 --> 00:12:46.212
on the precious.

99
00:12:48.643 --> 00:12:51.009
On the precious.

100
00:12:52.188 --> 00:12:53.678
I don't believe you!

101
00:12:55.692 --> 00:12:59.276
Get down! I said. down! Sam!

102
00:12:59.362 --> 00:13:01.148
He's trying to trick us.

103
00:13:01.239 --> 00:13:04.356
If we let him go. he'll throttle us
in our sleep.

104
00:13:15.753 --> 00:13:20.292
You know the way to mordor? Yes

105
00:13:23.219 --> 00:13:24.959
you've been there before?

106
00:13:25.972 --> 00:13:27.553
Yes

107
00:13:38.443 --> 00:13:41.059
You will lead us to the black gate.

108
00:13:49.704 --> 00:13:53.572
Smeagol: To the gate. to the gate!
To the gate. the master says. Yes!

109
00:13:53.666 --> 00:13:58.581
Gollum: No! We won't go back.
Not there. Not to him.

110
00:13:58.671 --> 00:14:03.005
They can't make us. Gollum! Gollum!

111
00:14:03.092 --> 00:14:06.630
But we swore to serve the master
of the precious.

112
00:14:06.721 --> 00:14:12.762
No. Ashes and dust and thirst there is.
and pits. pits. pits.

113
00:14:12.852 --> 00:14:15.810
And orcses. thousands of orcses.

114
00:14:15.897 --> 00:14:21.062
And always the great eye watching.
watching.

115
00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:27.864
Hey! Come back now! Come back!

116
00:14:30.244 --> 00:14:32.530
There! What did I tell you?

117
00:14:32.622 --> 00:14:34.908
He's run off. the old villain.

118
00:14:34.999 --> 00:14:37.615
So much for his promises.

119
00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:39.450
Smeagol: This way. hobbits.

120
00:14:39.545 --> 00:14:41.661
Follow Mel

121
00:14:57.855 --> 00:14:59.345
Merry!

122
00:15:04.904 --> 00:15:08.738
You're late.
Our master grows impatient.

123
00:15:08.825 --> 00:15:10.690
He wants the shire-rats now.

124
00:15:11.536 --> 00:15:16.121
I don't take orders from orc-maggots.

125
00:15:17.166 --> 00:15:20.283
Saruman will have his prize.

126
00:15:20.378 --> 00:15:23.586
We will deliver them.

127
00:15:29.804 --> 00:15:31.169
Merry!

128
00:15:31.931 --> 00:15:33.671
Merry? Wake up.

129
00:15:37.145 --> 00:15:39.010
My friend is sick.

130
00:15:39.439 --> 00:15:42.101
He needs water. Please!

131
00:15:42.859 --> 00:15:46.852
Sick. is he?
Give him some medicine. boys!

132
00:15:50.032 --> 00:15:51.693
Stop it!

133
00:15:53.911 --> 00:15:56.527
Can't take his draught!

134
00:15:59.208 --> 00:16:01.824
- Leave him alone!
- Why?

135
00:16:02.336 --> 00:16:05.328
You want some? Huh?

136
00:16:05.423 --> 00:16:08.836
Then keep your mouth shut.

137
00:16:12.263 --> 00:16:14.345
Merry.

138
00:16:15.141 --> 00:16:16.677
Hello. pip.

139
00:16:18.478 --> 00:16:20.969
You're hurt. I'm fine.

140
00:16:21.063 --> 00:16:23.645
It was just an act. An act?

141
00:16:24.275 --> 00:16:27.142
See? I fooled you too.

142
00:16:29.864 --> 00:16:31.570
Don't worry about me. pippin.

143
00:16:33.868 --> 00:16:35.859
What is it? What do you smell?

144
00:16:36.871 --> 00:16:38.156
Man-flesh.

145
00:16:40.291 --> 00:16:42.657
They've picked up our trail.

146
00:16:43.753 --> 00:16:44.868
Aragorn.

147
00:16:46.589 --> 00:16:48.420
I et's move!

148
00:17:11.989 --> 00:17:14.526
Their pace has quickened.

149
00:17:15.535 --> 00:17:17.571
They must have caught our scent.

150
00:17:17.662 --> 00:17:19.448
Hurry!

151
00:17:23.084 --> 00:17:24.870
Come on. gimli!

152
00:17:28.673 --> 00:17:31.005
Three days and nights pursuit.

153
00:17:31.092 --> 00:17:34.129
No food no rest

154
00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:38.259
and no sign of our quarry.
but what bare rock can tell

155
00:18:09.714 --> 00:18:12.956
Not idly do the leaves of lorien fall.

156
00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:16.592
They may yet be alive.

157
00:18:17.471 --> 00:18:20.087
Less than a day ahead of us. Come.

158
00:18:22.685 --> 00:18:25.222
Come. gimli! We're gaining on them!

159
00:18:25.313 --> 00:18:29.647
I'm wasted on cross-country.
We dwarves are natural sprinters.

160
00:18:30.151 --> 00:18:33.484
Very dangerous over short distances.

161
00:18:45.166 --> 00:18:46.952
Aragorn: Rohan.

162
00:18:47.043 --> 00:18:49.876
Home of the horse-lords.

163
00:18:51.088 --> 00:18:53.670
There's something strange at work here.

164
00:18:53.758 --> 00:18:56.875
Some evil gives speed
to these creatures.

165
00:18:56.969 --> 00:18:59.927
Sets its will against us.

166
00:19:05.144 --> 00:19:08.056
Aragorn:
Legolas! What do your elf-eyes see?

167
00:19:08.147 --> 00:19:10.763
Legolas:
The uruks turn northeast.

168
00:19:11.609 --> 00:19:13.770
They are taking the hobbits to isengard.

169
00:19:14.654 --> 00:19:15.894
Saruman.

170
00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:27.538
Saruman: The world is changing.

171
00:19:27.625 --> 00:19:33.291
Who now has the strength to stand
against the armies of isengard...

172
00:19:33.964 --> 00:19:36.706
And mordor?

173
00:19:38.386 --> 00:19:44.052
To stand against the might of Sauron
and saruman.

174
00:19:44.141 --> 00:19:47.850
And the union of the two towers?

175
00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:57.352
Together. my lord Sauron...

176
00:19:57.446 --> 00:20:01.064
We shall rule this middle-earth

177
00:20:17.091 --> 00:20:21.334
Saruman: The old world will burn
in the fires of industry.

178
00:20:21.887 --> 00:20:25.175
The forests will fall

179
00:20:27.101 --> 00:20:29.934
a new order will rise.

180
00:20:31.021 --> 00:20:35.981
We will drive the machine of war
with the sword and the spear...

181
00:20:36.068 --> 00:20:40.107
And the iron fists of the orc.

182
00:20:52.543 --> 00:20:55.785
Saruman: I want them armed
and ready to march within two weeks!

183
00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:57.620
Orc:
But. my lord. there are too many!

184
00:20:57.715 --> 00:21:00.798
We cannot all be armed in time.
we don't have the means.

185
00:21:00.885 --> 00:21:04.127
Build a dam. block the stream.
work the furnaces night and day.

186
00:21:04.722 --> 00:21:07.134
We don't have enough fuel
to feed the fires.

187
00:21:08.434 --> 00:21:12.723
The forest of fangorn
lies on our doorstep.

188
00:21:14.148 --> 00:21:16.480
Burn it. Yes.

189
00:21:17.193 --> 00:21:19.525
Wild man: We will fight for you.

190
00:21:19.612 --> 00:21:21.648
Swear it.

191
00:21:32.166 --> 00:21:36.910
We will die for saruman.

192
00:21:38.005 --> 00:21:40.041
Saruman:
The horse-men took your lands.

193
00:21:40.132 --> 00:21:44.751
They drove your people into the hills
to scratch a living off rocks.

194
00:21:44.845 --> 00:21:46.301
Murderers!

195
00:21:47.223 --> 00:21:49.384
Saruman:
Take back the lands they stole from you.

196
00:21:49.475 --> 00:21:51.306
Burn every village!

197
00:21:54.522 --> 00:21:59.687
Saruman: We have only to
remove those who oppose us.

198
00:22:00.194 --> 00:22:02.731
It will begin in Rohan.

199
00:22:03.489 --> 00:22:07.073
Too long have these peasants
stood against you.

200
00:22:07.159 --> 00:22:09.070
But no more.

201
00:22:09.161 --> 00:22:11.402
Eothain! Eothain!

202
00:22:13.582 --> 00:22:16.244
You take your sister.
You'll go faster with just two.

203
00:22:16.627 --> 00:22:19.334
Freda:
Papa says eothain must not ride garulf.

204
00:22:19.421 --> 00:22:21.161
He is too big for him.

205
00:22:21.257 --> 00:22:24.340
Listen to me. You must ride to edoras
and raise the alarm.

206
00:22:24.426 --> 00:22:27.008
- Do you understand me?
- Yes. mama.

207
00:22:27.263 --> 00:22:30.221
I don't want to leave.
I don't want to go. mama.

208
00:22:30.307 --> 00:22:34.095
Freda. I will find you there.

209
00:22:38.983 --> 00:22:40.723
Quickly!

210
00:22:47.074 --> 00:22:48.655
Go. child.

211
00:23:01.505 --> 00:23:03.496
Saruman: Rohan. my lord...

212
00:23:03.924 --> 00:23:06.757
Is ready to fall.

213
00:23:17.897 --> 00:23:19.512
Thodred.

214
00:23:19.607 --> 00:23:21.268
Find the king's son!

215
00:23:37.708 --> 00:23:43.795
Mordor will pay for this.
These orcs are not from mordor.

216
00:23:44.632 --> 00:23:47.465
My lord eomer. over here!

217
00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:57.971
He's alive.

218
00:24:28.926 --> 00:24:31.008
Thodred.

219
00:24:44.358 --> 00:24:47.395
Eowyn:
Your son is badly wounded. my lord.

220
00:24:47.861 --> 00:24:50.352
He was ambushed by orcs.

221
00:24:51.865 --> 00:24:55.483
If we don't defend our country.
saruman will take it by force.

222
00:24:55.869 --> 00:24:58.360
That is a lie.

223
00:25:00.541 --> 00:25:05.410
Saruman the white has ever been
our friend and ally.

224
00:25:07.047 --> 00:25:09.083
Theoden: Grima.

225
00:25:10.509 --> 00:25:12.420
Grima.

226
00:25:14.972 --> 00:25:16.508
Grima.

227
00:25:17.266 --> 00:25:20.383
Orcs are roaming freely
across our lands.

228
00:25:20.728 --> 00:25:24.391
Unchecked. Unchallenged.
Killing at will.

229
00:25:25.024 --> 00:25:27.891
Orcs bearing the white hand of saruman.

230
00:25:35.743 --> 00:25:41.579
Why do you lay these troubles
on an already troubled mind?

231
00:25:41.665 --> 00:25:44.202
Can you not see?

232
00:25:44.293 --> 00:25:49.413
Your uncle is wearied
by your malcontent...

233
00:25:49.506 --> 00:25:52.088
Your warmongering.

234
00:25:54.303 --> 00:25:56.294
Warmongering?

235
00:25:56.388 --> 00:25:58.595
How long is it since
saruman bought you?

236
00:25:59.433 --> 00:26:01.799
What was the promised price. grima?

237
00:26:02.061 --> 00:26:05.724
When all the men are dead.
you will take your share of the treasure?

238
00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:20.867
Too long have you watched my sister.

239
00:26:20.954 --> 00:26:22.990
Too long have you haunted her steps.

240
00:26:31.048 --> 00:26:35.417
You see much. eomer. son of eomund.

241
00:26:35.511 --> 00:26:36.717
Too much.

242
00:26:39.014 --> 00:26:43.883
You are banished forthwith
from the kingdom of Rohan...

243
00:26:43.977 --> 00:26:48.812
And all its domains
under pain of death.

244
00:26:49.274 --> 00:26:51.640
You have no authority here.

245
00:26:51.735 --> 00:26:54.226
Your orders mean nothing.

246
00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:58.648
This order does not come from me.

247
00:26:58.742 --> 00:27:00.983
It comes from the king.

248
00:27:01.537 --> 00:27:04.199
He signed it this morning.

249
00:27:35.737 --> 00:27:38.524
Keep breathing. That's the key.

250
00:27:38.615 --> 00:27:40.355
Breathe

251
00:27:44.538 --> 00:27:48.326
they've run as if the very whips
of their masters were behind them.

252
00:28:04.558 --> 00:28:06.549
Orc 1:
We're not going no further...

253
00:28:06.643 --> 00:28:08.679
Until we've had a breather.

254
00:28:09.229 --> 00:28:11.185
Get a fire going!

255
00:28:15.277 --> 00:28:16.858
Merry!

256
00:28:17.196 --> 00:28:18.561
Merry!

257
00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:25.451
I think we might have made a mistake
leaving the shire. pippin.

258
00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:37.087
What's making that noise?

259
00:28:38.675 --> 00:28:40.131
It's the trees.

260
00:28:40.886 --> 00:28:41.921
What?

261
00:28:42.262 --> 00:28:46.130
You remember the old forest.
on the borders of buckland?

262
00:28:46.225 --> 00:28:50.810
Folk used to say there was something in
the water that made the trees grow tall...

263
00:28:50.896 --> 00:28:52.477
And come alive.

264
00:28:52.731 --> 00:28:54.392
Alive?

265
00:28:55.275 --> 00:28:56.981
Trees that could whisper...

266
00:28:57.986 --> 00:29:00.477
Talk to each other.

267
00:29:00.572 --> 00:29:02.483
Even move.

268
00:29:06.453 --> 00:29:10.571
We ain't had nothing but maggoty bread
for three stinking days.

269
00:29:10.916 --> 00:29:12.281
Yeah!

270
00:29:12.376 --> 00:29:15.664
Why can't we have some meat?!

271
00:29:18.048 --> 00:29:20.289
What about them?

272
00:29:20.384 --> 00:29:22.295
They're fresh.

273
00:29:22.970 --> 00:29:26.758
They are not for eating.

274
00:29:32.729 --> 00:29:34.720
What about their legs?

275
00:29:34.815 --> 00:29:37.181
They don't need those.

276
00:29:38.652 --> 00:29:41.815
- They look tasty.
Leader: Get back. scum!

277
00:29:43.657 --> 00:29:48.526
The prisoners go to saruman.
Alive and unspoiled.

278
00:29:48.912 --> 00:29:50.823
Alive?

279
00:29:53.792 --> 00:29:58.081
Why alive?
Do they give good sport?

280
00:30:00.465 --> 00:30:03.878
They have something.
An elvish weapon.

281
00:30:03.969 --> 00:30:07.052
The master wants it for the war.

282
00:30:09.933 --> 00:30:11.844
They think we have the ring.
Shh.

283
00:30:11.935 --> 00:30:14.392
As soon as they find out we don't.
we're dead.

284
00:30:16.273 --> 00:30:18.264
Just a mouthful

285
00:30:18.358 --> 00:30:19.598
a bit of the flank.

286
00:30:26.408 --> 00:30:30.071
Looks like meat's back on the menu.
boys.

287
00:30:36.585 --> 00:30:37.870
Pippin.

288
00:30:37.961 --> 00:30:39.701
Let's go.

289
00:30:48.138 --> 00:30:49.719
(0 on.

290
00:30:49.806 --> 00:30:51.342
Call for help.

291
00:30:52.726 --> 00:30:53.886
Squeal.

292
00:30:53.977 --> 00:30:57.219
No one's going to save you now.

293
00:31:06.406 --> 00:31:07.816
Merry: Pippin!

294
00:31:32.057 --> 00:31:34.548
A red sun rises.

295
00:31:35.060 --> 00:31:37.972
Blood has been spilled this night.

296
00:32:09.219 --> 00:32:11.084
Riders of Rohan

297
00:32:11.513 --> 00:32:13.925
what news from the Mark?

298
00:32:41.668 --> 00:32:46.082
What business does an elf. a man
and a dwarf have in the riddermark?

299
00:32:46.882 --> 00:32:48.122
Speak quickly!

300
00:32:48.467 --> 00:32:53.131
Give me your name. horse-master.
and I shall give you mine.

301
00:33:02.272 --> 00:33:04.854
I would cut off your head. dwarf...

302
00:33:05.358 --> 00:33:07.644
If it stood but a little higher
from the ground.

303
00:33:08.695 --> 00:33:10.777
You would die before your stroke fell.

304
00:33:19.498 --> 00:33:21.363
I am aragorn. son of arathorn.

305
00:33:21.708 --> 00:33:25.951
This is gimli. son of gloin.
and Legolas of the woodland realm.

306
00:33:26.046 --> 00:33:29.379
We are friends of Rohan
and of thoden. your king.

307
00:33:31.009 --> 00:33:34.877
Theoden no longer recognizes
friend from foe.

308
00:33:34.971 --> 00:33:37.212
Not even his own kin.

309
00:33:41.728 --> 00:33:43.764
Saruman has poisoned the mind
of the king...

310
00:33:43.855 --> 00:33:45.811
And claimed lordship over these lands.

311
00:33:47.776 --> 00:33:50.813
My company are those loyal to Rohan.

312
00:33:50.904 --> 00:33:52.690
And for that. we are banished.

313
00:33:54.783 --> 00:33:58.071
The white wizard is cunning.

314
00:33:58.745 --> 00:34:01.202
He walks here and there. they say...

315
00:34:01.289 --> 00:34:03.405
As an old man hooded and cloaked.

316
00:34:05.252 --> 00:34:09.086
And everywhere. his spies
slip past our nets.

317
00:34:09.172 --> 00:34:11.458
We are no spies.

318
00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:14.542
We track a party of uruk-hai
westward across the plain.

319
00:34:14.844 --> 00:34:17.176
They have taken two of our friends
captive.

320
00:34:17.973 --> 00:34:20.464
The uruks are destroyed.
We slaughtered them during the night.

321
00:34:20.559 --> 00:34:23.801
But there were two hobbits.
Did you see two hobbits with them?

322
00:34:23.895 --> 00:34:26.932
They would be small.
Only children to your eyes.

323
00:34:30.235 --> 00:34:32.226
We left none alive.

324
00:34:32.946 --> 00:34:35.813
We piled the carcasses and burned them.

325
00:34:41.288 --> 00:34:42.528
Dead?

326
00:34:45.542 --> 00:34:47.248
I am sorry.

327
00:34:52.757 --> 00:34:55.089
Hasufell arod!

328
00:34:56.970 --> 00:35:01.589
May these horses bear you to better
fortune than their former masters.

329
00:35:09.608 --> 00:35:11.894
Look for your friends.

330
00:35:12.319 --> 00:35:14.560
But do not trust to hope.

331
00:35:16.281 --> 00:35:18.897
It has forsaken these lands.

332
00:35:18.992 --> 00:35:21.028
We ride north!

333
00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:13.535
It's one of their wee belts.

334
00:36:27.268 --> 00:36:29.304
We failed them.

335
00:36:43.368 --> 00:36:45.575
A hobbit lay here.

336
00:36:47.414 --> 00:36:49.075
And the other.

337
00:36:59.843 --> 00:37:01.424
They crawled.

338
00:37:05.598 --> 00:37:07.714
Their hands were bound.

339
00:37:19.863 --> 00:37:21.694
Their bonds were cut.

340
00:37:37.130 --> 00:37:39.246
They ran over here.

341
00:37:42.927 --> 00:37:44.133
They were followed.

342
00:37:47.307 --> 00:37:49.047
Merry: The belt!

343
00:37:52.937 --> 00:37:54.143
Run!

344
00:37:57.776 --> 00:37:59.176
Tracks lead away from the battle...

345
00:38:03.990 --> 00:38:06.151
Into fangorn forest.

346
00:38:06.993 --> 00:38:08.529
Fangorn?

347
00:38:08.620 --> 00:38:11.236
What madness drove them in there?

348
00:38:28.932 --> 00:38:31.969
Pippin:
Did we lose him? I think we lost him.

349
00:38:38.691 --> 00:38:42.104
I'm going to rip out
your filthy little innards!

350
00:38:48.284 --> 00:38:49.319
Come here!

351
00:38:54.833 --> 00:38:57.415
Trees. Climb a tree.

352
00:39:06.761 --> 00:39:08.501
He's gone.

353
00:39:20.567 --> 00:39:22.899
Merry!

354
00:39:34.372 --> 00:39:38.741
Let's put a maggot hole in your belly!

355
00:39:45.884 --> 00:39:47.420
Run. merry!

356
00:39:57.270 --> 00:40:01.639
Little orcs.

357
00:40:01.733 --> 00:40:04.145
It's talking. merry.
The tree is talking.

358
00:40:04.235 --> 00:40:06.146
Tree?

359
00:40:06.237 --> 00:40:09.354
I am no tree!

360
00:40:09.449 --> 00:40:11.690
I am an ent.

361
00:40:12.285 --> 00:40:14.401
A tree-herder.

362
00:40:14.913 --> 00:40:16.949
A Shepherd of the forest.

363
00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:18.405
Don't talk to it. merry.

364
00:40:18.917 --> 00:40:20.453
Don't encourage it!

365
00:40:20.543 --> 00:40:24.877
Treebeard. some call me.

366
00:40:24.964 --> 00:40:26.955
And whose side are you on?

367
00:40:27.592 --> 00:40:29.298
Side?

368
00:40:29.385 --> 00:40:32.297
I am on nobody's side...

369
00:40:32.639 --> 00:40:37.975
Pecause nobody's on my side.
little orc.

370
00:40:38.811 --> 00:40:43.430
Nobody cares for the woods anymore.

371
00:40:43.816 --> 00:40:46.228
We're not orcs! We're hobbits!

372
00:40:46.319 --> 00:40:48.651
Hobbits?

373
00:40:49.906 --> 00:40:54.821
Never heard of a hobbit before.

374
00:40:55.954 --> 00:40:59.287
Sounds like orc mischief to me!

375
00:41:00.583 --> 00:41:02.915
They come with fire.

376
00:41:03.002 --> 00:41:05.709
They come with axes.

377
00:41:05.797 --> 00:41:10.712
Gnawing. biting. breaking.
hacking. burning!

378
00:41:10.802 --> 00:41:14.715
- Destroyers and usurpers! Curse them!
- No!

379
00:41:14.806 --> 00:41:17.718
You don't understand. We're hobbits!

380
00:41:17.809 --> 00:41:19.720
Halflings!

381
00:41:19.811 --> 00:41:21.017
Shire-folk!

382
00:41:21.104 --> 00:41:23.470
Maybe you are...

383
00:41:23.773 --> 00:41:27.391
And maybe you aren't.

384
00:41:28.486 --> 00:41:32.399
The white wizard will know.

385
00:41:33.199 --> 00:41:35.155
The white wizard?

386
00:41:36.661 --> 00:41:38.151
Saruman.

387
00:41:50.717 --> 00:41:52.503
Gollum: See? See?

388
00:41:52.593 --> 00:41:55.050
We've led you out.

389
00:41:55.138 --> 00:41:57.720
Hurry. hobbitses. Hurry!

390
00:42:00.810 --> 00:42:03.392
Very lucky we find you.

391
00:42:10.028 --> 00:42:11.734
Nice hobbit

392
00:42:13.406 --> 00:42:17.945
oh! It's a bog. He's led us into a swamp.

393
00:42:18.036 --> 00:42:20.698
A swamp. yes. yes.

394
00:42:21.456 --> 00:42:26.200
Come. master. We will take you
on safe paths through the mist.

395
00:42:28.504 --> 00:42:31.962
Come. hobbits! Come! We go quickly.

396
00:42:35.219 --> 00:42:37.926
I found it. I did.

397
00:42:38.014 --> 00:42:40.801
The way through the marshes.

398
00:42:40.892 --> 00:42:44.476
Orcs don't use it.
Orcs don't know it.

399
00:42:44.562 --> 00:42:48.680
They go around for miles and miles.

400
00:42:48.941 --> 00:42:50.397
Come quickly.

401
00:42:50.485 --> 00:42:54.569
Soft and quick as shadows we must be.

402
00:42:55.740 --> 00:42:59.107
I hate this place. It's too quiet.

403
00:42:59.202 --> 00:43:01.534
There's been no sight nor sound
of a bird for two days.

404
00:43:01.621 --> 00:43:05.079
No. no birdses to eat.

405
00:43:05.333 --> 00:43:09.576
No crunchable birdses.

406
00:43:10.171 --> 00:43:13.083
And we are famished! Yes!

407
00:43:13.174 --> 00:43:17.508
Famished we are. precious!

408
00:43:32.485 --> 00:43:33.975
Here

409
00:43:35.154 --> 00:43:37.236
gollum: What does it eats?

410
00:43:37.323 --> 00:43:39.314
Is it tasty?

411
00:43:44.622 --> 00:43:47.238
It tries to chokes us!

412
00:43:47.500 --> 00:43:51.163
We can't eats hobbit food!

413
00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:56.964
We must starve!

414
00:43:57.051 --> 00:43:59.508
Well. starve. then. And good riddance!

415
00:44:00.221 --> 00:44:02.507
Oh. cruel hobbit.

416
00:44:02.598 --> 00:44:05.590
It does not care if we be hungry.

417
00:44:05.685 --> 00:44:10.520
Does not care if we should die.

418
00:44:11.107 --> 00:44:13.940
Not like master.

419
00:44:15.319 --> 00:44:17.401
Master cares.

420
00:44:18.573 --> 00:44:20.438
Master knows.

421
00:44:22.910 --> 00:44:24.901
Yes

422
00:44:24.996 --> 00:44:27.658
precious.

423
00:44:31.252 --> 00:44:34.870
Once it takes hold of us

424
00:44:36.716 --> 00:44:40.925
it never lets go.

425
00:44:41.596 --> 00:44:42.756
Don't touch me!

426
00:45:15.254 --> 00:45:17.165
Sam: There are dead things!

427
00:45:17.256 --> 00:45:19.087
Dead faces in the water.

428
00:45:23.888 --> 00:45:27.881
Gollum: All dead. All rotten.

429
00:45:28.392 --> 00:45:32.226
Flves and men and orcses.

430
00:45:32.313 --> 00:45:35.976
A great battle long ago.

431
00:45:36.776 --> 00:45:38.607
Dead marshes.

432
00:45:38.694 --> 00:45:41.436
Yes. Yes. that is their name.

433
00:45:43.115 --> 00:45:44.980
This way.

434
00:45:45.076 --> 00:45:47.818
Don't follow the lights.

435
00:45:49.622 --> 00:45:53.490
Careful now! Or hobbits go down
to join the dead ones...

436
00:45:53.584 --> 00:45:57.748
And light little candles
of their own.

437
00:46:23.948 --> 00:46:25.438
Frodo!

438
00:47:09.952 --> 00:47:14.662
- Gollum?
- Don't follow the lights.

439
00:47:14.749 --> 00:47:16.580
Frodo: Gollum! Mr Frodo!

440
00:47:16.834 --> 00:47:18.699
Are you all right?

441
00:47:47.531 --> 00:47:50.614
Gollum: So bright.

442
00:47:50.701 --> 00:47:54.614
So beautiful

443
00:47:54.705 --> 00:47:58.539
our precious.

444
00:48:00.002 --> 00:48:01.458
What did you say?

445
00:48:01.754 --> 00:48:03.961
Master should be resting.

446
00:48:04.048 --> 00:48:08.166
Master needs to keep up his strength.

447
00:48:10.137 --> 00:48:13.425
- Who are you?
- Mustn't ask us. Not its business.

448
00:48:13.516 --> 00:48:15.097
Gollum. Gollum.

449
00:48:15.184 --> 00:48:17.140
Gandalf told me you were
one of the river-folk

450
00:48:17.228 --> 00:48:21.346
cold be heart and hand and bone
cold be travelers far from home

451
00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:23.146
he said your life was a sad story.

452
00:48:23.234 --> 00:48:27.819
They do not see what lies ahead
when sun has failed and moon is dead

453
00:48:27.905 --> 00:48:30.988
you were not so very different
from a hobbit once

454
00:48:31.075 --> 00:48:32.906
were you?

455
00:48:35.079 --> 00:48:37.320
Smeagol.

456
00:48:42.044 --> 00:48:44.581
What did you call me?

457
00:48:45.923 --> 00:48:48.665
That was your name once. wasn't it?

458
00:48:49.301 --> 00:48:51.587
A long time ago.

459
00:48:52.430 --> 00:48:54.591
My name.

460
00:48:55.683 --> 00:48:57.173
My name.

461
00:49:04.108 --> 00:49:06.599
Smeagol.

462
00:49:10.698 --> 00:49:12.359
Black riders!

463
00:49:12.450 --> 00:49:13.860
Hide! Hide!

464
00:49:24.420 --> 00:49:26.752
Come on. Frodo. Come on!

465
00:49:26.839 --> 00:49:30.502
Smeagol: Quick! They will see us!
They will see us!

466
00:49:31.343 --> 00:49:34.005
- I thought they were dead.
- Dead?

467
00:49:34.096 --> 00:49:37.054
No. you cannot kill them. No.

468
00:50:04.210 --> 00:50:05.370
Smeagol: Wraiths!

469
00:50:05.461 --> 00:50:07.702
Wraiths on wings!

470
00:50:15.679 --> 00:50:17.840
They are calling for it.

471
00:50:17.932 --> 00:50:21.424
They are calling for the precious.

472
00:50:23.646 --> 00:50:25.807
Mr. Frodo! It's all right.

473
00:50:25.898 --> 00:50:27.183
I'm here.

474
00:50:43.207 --> 00:50:44.743
Smeagol: Hurry. hobbits.

475
00:50:45.292 --> 00:50:49.205
The black gate is very close.

476
00:50:56.053 --> 00:50:57.964
Orc blood.

477
00:51:07.982 --> 00:51:09.722
These are strange tracks.

478
00:51:11.026 --> 00:51:12.982
The air is so close in here.

479
00:51:14.196 --> 00:51:16.608
This forest is old.

480
00:51:17.449 --> 00:51:19.440
Very old.

481
00:51:21.161 --> 00:51:23.447
Full of memory...

482
00:51:26.083 --> 00:51:28.449
And anger.

483
00:51:34.592 --> 00:51:37.504
The trees are speaking to each other.

484
00:51:37.595 --> 00:51:39.176
Aragorn: Gimli!

485
00:51:39.263 --> 00:51:41.254
Lower your ax.

486
00:51:44.059 --> 00:51:46.801
They have feelings. my friend.

487
00:51:47.354 --> 00:51:49.390
The elves began it.

488
00:51:49.481 --> 00:51:54.271
Waking up the trees.
teaching them to speak.

489
00:51:54.778 --> 00:51:57.110
Talking trees.

490
00:51:57.781 --> 00:52:00.864
What do trees have to talk about?

491
00:52:00.951 --> 00:52:04.193
Except the consistency
of squirrel droppings.

492
00:52:18.135 --> 00:52:20.592
The white wizard approaches.

493
00:52:26.769 --> 00:52:31.058
Do not let him speak.
He will put a spell on us.

494
00:52:40.658 --> 00:52:42.899
We must be quick.

495
00:52:58.467 --> 00:53:02.130
White wizard: You are tracking
the footsteps of two young hobbits.

496
00:53:02.721 --> 00:53:04.177
Where are they?

497
00:53:04.264 --> 00:53:07.927
White wizard: They passed this way
the day before yesterday.

498
00:53:08.018 --> 00:53:12.352
They met someone they did not expect.

499
00:53:12.439 --> 00:53:14.646
Does that comfort you?

500
00:53:14.733 --> 00:53:16.724
Who are you?

501
00:53:18.195 --> 00:53:20.186
Show yourself!

502
00:53:29.081 --> 00:53:31.072
It cannot be.

503
00:53:34.002 --> 00:53:35.082
Forgive me.

504
00:53:36.672 --> 00:53:38.583
I mistook you for saruman.

505
00:53:39.383 --> 00:53:42.125
I am saruman.

506
00:53:43.679 --> 00:53:47.592
Or rather. saruman
a8 he should have been.

507
00:53:48.517 --> 00:53:50.007
You fell.

508
00:53:51.478 --> 00:53:54.060
Through fire...

509
00:53:54.148 --> 00:53:55.479
And water.

510
00:53:56.942 --> 00:53:59.524
From the lowest dungeon
to the highest peak...

511
00:53:59.611 --> 00:54:03.399
I fought with the balrog
of morgoth.

512
00:54:19.256 --> 00:54:21.998
Gandalf: Until at last
I threw down my enemy...

513
00:54:22.092 --> 00:54:26.631
And smote his ruin
upon the mountainside.

514
00:54:32.644 --> 00:54:35.181
Darkness took me.

515
00:54:35.939 --> 00:54:40.023
And I strayed out of thought
and time.

516
00:54:40.778 --> 00:54:43.861
Stars wheeled overhead.

517
00:54:44.156 --> 00:54:48.650
And every day was as long
as a life age of the earth.

518
00:54:50.746 --> 00:54:52.862
But it was not the end.

519
00:54:53.165 --> 00:54:55.952
I felt life in me again.

520
00:54:57.878 --> 00:55:00.460
['Ve been sent back

521
00:55:00.547 --> 00:55:02.162
until my task is done.

522
00:55:02.591 --> 00:55:04.456
(Sandalf.

523
00:55:05.177 --> 00:55:07.168
(Gandalf?

524
00:55:07.554 --> 00:55:09.340
Yes

525
00:55:12.184 --> 00:55:13.924
that was what they used to call me.

526
00:55:16.814 --> 00:55:19.055
Gandalf the grey.

527
00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:22.265
That was my name.

528
00:55:22.361 --> 00:55:23.771
(Sandalf.

529
00:55:25.739 --> 00:55:27.821
I am Gandalf the white

530
00:55:30.828 --> 00:55:33.945
and I come back to you now...

531
00:55:34.039 --> 00:55:36.576
At the turn of the tide.

532
00:55:37.709 --> 00:55:40.701
One stage of your journey is over.
Another begins.

533
00:55:41.421 --> 00:55:44.584
- We must travel to edoras with all speed.
Gimli: Edoras?

534
00:55:45.509 --> 00:55:47.545
That is no short distance!

535
00:55:47.803 --> 00:55:51.091
We hear of trouble in Rohan.
It goes ill with the king.

536
00:55:51.181 --> 00:55:53.342
Yes. and it will not be easily cured.

537
00:55:53.433 --> 00:55:56.925
Then we have run all this way for nothing?

538
00:55:57.020 --> 00:55:59.102
Are we to leave those poor hobbits here...

539
00:55:59.189 --> 00:56:03.182
In this horrid. dark. dank.
tree-infested...?

540
00:56:06.071 --> 00:56:09.279
I mean. charming...

541
00:56:09.366 --> 00:56:12.153
Quite charming forest.

542
00:56:12.744 --> 00:56:16.407
It was more than mere chance that
brought merry and pippin to fangorn.

543
00:56:16.498 --> 00:56:20.912
A great power has been sleeping here
for many long years.

544
00:56:21.003 --> 00:56:24.541
The coming of merry and pippin
will be like the falling of small stones...

545
00:56:24.631 --> 00:56:28.044
That starts an avalanche
in the mountains.

546
00:56:28.135 --> 00:56:30.376
In one thing you have not changed.
dear friend.

547
00:56:30.470 --> 00:56:34.930
- Hm?
- You still speak in riddles.

548
00:56:37.769 --> 00:56:44.231
A thing is about to happen that has not
happened since the elder days.

549
00:56:44.318 --> 00:56:47.981
The ents are going to wake up...

550
00:56:48.530 --> 00:56:53.024
- And find that they are strong.
- Strong?!

551
00:56:53.785 --> 00:56:54.991
Oh. that's good.

552
00:56:55.078 --> 00:56:57.820
So stop your fretting. master dwarf.

553
00:56:58.916 --> 00:57:01.202
Merry and pippin are quite safe.

554
00:57:01.293 --> 00:57:05.036
In fact. they are far safer
than you are about to be.

555
00:57:05.130 --> 00:57:08.918
This new Gandalf's more grumpy
than the old one.

556
00:57:31.156 --> 00:57:32.692
That is one of the mearas

557
00:57:32.783 --> 00:57:35.570
unless my eyes are cheated
by some spell.

558
00:57:53.178 --> 00:57:55.464
Gandalf: Shadowfax

559
00:57:58.058 --> 00:58:00.640
he is the lord of all horses

560
00:58:02.270 --> 00:58:06.183
and has been my friend
through many dangers.

561
00:58:20.455 --> 00:58:24.073
Treebeard: O Rowan mine

562
00:58:24.167 --> 00:58:28.035
I saw you shine

563
00:58:28.130 --> 00:58:31.714
upon a summer's day

564
00:58:32.801 --> 00:58:37.340
upon your head how golden-red

565
00:58:37.431 --> 00:58:42.266
the crown you bore aloft

566
00:58:42.352 --> 00:58:44.809
such a beautiful verse.

567
00:58:44.896 --> 00:58:49.890
- Is it much further?
- Bru-ra-hroom. Don't be hasty.

568
00:58:49.985 --> 00:58:53.273
You might call it far. perhaps.

569
00:58:54.197 --> 00:58:58.065
My home lies deep in the forest...

570
00:58:58.160 --> 00:59:02.073
Near the roots of the mountain.

571
00:59:03.415 --> 00:59:07.158
I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.

572
00:59:07.252 --> 00:59:11.291
And safe is where I'll keep you.

573
00:59:11.548 --> 00:59:15.917
I believe you will enjoy this next one too.

574
00:59:16.303 --> 00:59:19.340
It's one of my own compositions.

575
00:59:19.431 --> 00:59:20.716
Right.

576
00:59:20.807 --> 00:59:27.019
Beneath the roof of sleeping leaves

577
00:59:27.105 --> 00:59:32.065
and the dreams of trees unfold

578
00:59:32.152 --> 00:59:38.694
when woodland halls are green and cool

579
00:59:38.784 --> 00:59:42.948
and the wind is in the west

580
00:59:43.371 --> 00:59:46.033
come back to me

581
00:59:46.583 --> 00:59:51.077
come back to me

582
00:59:51.171 --> 00:59:57.633
and say my land is best

583
00:59:59.137 --> 01:00:01.093
oh.

584
01:00:05.102 --> 01:00:08.845
Sleep. little shirelings.

585
01:00:08.939 --> 01:00:12.557
Heed no nightly noise.

586
01:00:12.651 --> 01:00:16.610
Sleep till morning light.

587
01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:22.449
I have business in the forest.

588
01:00:22.536 --> 01:00:28.122
There are many to call.
Many that must come.

589
01:00:29.334 --> 01:00:34.044
The shadow lies on fangorn.

590
01:00:34.131 --> 01:00:39.876
The withering of all woods
is drawing near.

591
01:00:49.437 --> 01:00:53.680
The veiling shadow that glowers
in the east takes shape.

592
01:00:54.526 --> 01:00:57.108
Sauron will suffer no rival.

593
01:00:57.529 --> 01:01:01.898
From the summit of barad-dur.
his eye watches ceaselessly.

594
01:01:01.992 --> 01:01:05.405
But he is not so mighty yet
that he is above fear.

595
01:01:06.454 --> 01:01:08.445
Doubt ever gnaws at him.

596
01:01:08.540 --> 01:01:11.202
The rumor has reached him.

597
01:01:11.293 --> 01:01:14.285
The heir of niumenor still lives.

598
01:01:15.255 --> 01:01:18.088
Sauron fears you. aragorn.

599
01:01:19.384 --> 01:01:21.591
He fears what you may become.

600
01:01:22.846 --> 01:01:26.304
And so he'll strike hard and fast
at the world of men.

601
01:01:26.391 --> 01:01:30.100
He will use his puppet. saruman.
to destroy Rohan.

602
01:01:30.187 --> 01:01:31.768
War is coming.

603
01:01:31.855 --> 01:01:35.518
Rohan must defend itself.
and therein lies our first challenge...

604
01:01:35.609 --> 01:01:38.100
For Rohan is weak and ready to fall.

605
01:01:38.195 --> 01:01:41.983
The king's mind is enslaved.
it's an old device of saruman's.

606
01:01:42.073 --> 01:01:45.236
His hold over king theoden
is now very strong.

607
01:01:45.327 --> 01:01:50.071
Sauron and saruman
are tightening the noose.

608
01:01:50.874 --> 01:01:53.081
But for all their cunning...

609
01:01:53.168 --> 01:01:55.784
We have one advantage.

610
01:01:57.923 --> 01:02:00.505
The ring remains hidden.

611
01:02:01.593 --> 01:02:03.549
And that we should seek to destroy it...

612
01:02:03.637 --> 01:02:06.629
Has not yet entered
their darkest dreams.

613
01:02:07.224 --> 01:02:10.591
And so the weapon of the enemy
is moving towards mordor...

614
01:02:10.685 --> 01:02:12.266
In the hands of a hobbit.

615
01:02:12.354 --> 01:02:16.518
Each day brings it closer
to the fires of mount doom.

616
01:02:16.608 --> 01:02:19.315
We must trust now in Frodo.

617
01:02:19.402 --> 01:02:21.313
Everything depends upon speed...

618
01:02:21.404 --> 01:02:24.441
And the secrecy of his quest.

619
01:02:26.409 --> 01:02:29.742
Do not regret your decision to leave him.

620
01:02:30.622 --> 01:02:33.364
Frodo must finish this task alone.

621
01:02:34.125 --> 01:02:36.491
He's not alone.

622
01:02:36.586 --> 01:02:38.292
Sam went with him.

623
01:02:38.964 --> 01:02:40.204
Did he?

624
01:02:40.298 --> 01:02:44.962
Did he. indeed? Good.

625
01:02:45.637 --> 01:02:48.003
Yes. very good.

626
01:02:56.022 --> 01:03:00.891
Smeagol:
The black gate of mordor.

627
01:03:03.697 --> 01:03:06.188
Oh. save us.

628
01:03:11.955 --> 01:03:15.197
My old gaffer would have a thing or two
to say if he could see us now.

629
01:03:17.460 --> 01:03:21.954
Smeagol: Master says to
show him the way into mordor.

630
01:03:22.048 --> 01:03:25.540
So good smeagol does.
master says so.

631
01:03:25.635 --> 01:03:26.920
I did.

632
01:03:35.687 --> 01:03:37.678
That's it. then.

633
01:03:39.232 --> 01:03:40.517
We can't get past that.

634
01:04:25.737 --> 01:04:27.102
I ook!

635
01:04:27.197 --> 01:04:28.733
The gate.

636
01:04:28.823 --> 01:04:30.063
It's opening!

637
01:04:37.499 --> 01:04:39.490
I can see a way down.

638
01:04:40.251 --> 01:04:42.333
Sam. no!

639
01:04:44.506 --> 01:04:45.871
Master!

640
01:06:09.716 --> 01:06:13.254
- I do not ask you to come with me. Sam.
- I know. Mr. Frodo.

641
01:06:14.012 --> 01:06:17.175
I doubt even these elvish cloaks
will hide us in there.

642
01:06:17.599 --> 01:06:19.464
Now! Smeagol: No!

643
01:06:20.018 --> 01:06:21.929
No! No. master!

644
01:06:22.187 --> 01:06:25.179
They catch you! They catch you!

645
01:06:26.483 --> 01:06:29.020
Don't take it to him.

646
01:06:31.988 --> 01:06:34.730
He wants the precious.

647
01:06:34.824 --> 01:06:37.941
Always he is looking for it.

648
01:06:38.036 --> 01:06:42.075
And the precious is wanting
to go back to him.

649
01:06:42.165 --> 01:06:46.124
But we mustn't let him have it.

650
01:06:52.509 --> 01:06:54.670
No! There's another way.

651
01:06:54.761 --> 01:06:57.468
More secret. A dark way.

652
01:06:57.764 --> 01:07:01.427
- Why haven't you spoken of this before?
- Because master did not ask.

653
01:07:01.893 --> 01:07:03.008
He's up to something.

654
01:07:03.603 --> 01:07:06.265
Are you saying there's another way
into mordor?

655
01:07:06.356 --> 01:07:09.143
Yes. There's a path...

656
01:07:09.234 --> 01:07:11.850
And some stairs.

657
01:07:11.945 --> 01:07:13.685
And then

658
01:07:13.780 --> 01:07:17.147
gq tunnel.

659
01:07:31.130 --> 01:07:32.961
He's led us this far. Sam.

660
01:07:33.049 --> 01:07:34.505
Mr. Frodo. no.

661
01:07:35.635 --> 01:07:37.091
He's been true to his word.

662
01:07:41.975 --> 01:07:43.181
No

663
01:07:45.311 --> 01:07:46.926
Lead the way. smeagol.

664
01:07:47.564 --> 01:07:51.477
Good smeagol always helps.

665
01:08:25.476 --> 01:08:26.476
Hello?

666
01:08:28.896 --> 01:08:30.932
Treebeard?

667
01:08:31.608 --> 01:08:33.018
Where has he gone?

668
01:08:33.109 --> 01:08:35.600
Pippin:
I had the loveliest dream last night.

669
01:08:36.237 --> 01:08:38.979
There was this large barrel.
full of pipe-weed.

670
01:08:39.073 --> 01:08:41.610
And we smoked all of it.
And then

671
01:08:42.118 --> 01:08:44.029
you were sick.

672
01:08:45.622 --> 01:08:48.489
I'd give anything for a whiff of old Toby.

673
01:08:52.003 --> 01:08:53.914
Did you hear that?

674
01:09:01.012 --> 01:09:02.502
There it is again.

675
01:09:03.348 --> 01:09:06.966
Something's not right here.
Not right at all.

676
01:09:11.773 --> 01:09:14.731
You just said something... treeish.

677
01:09:14.817 --> 01:09:18.856
No. I didn't. I was just stretching.

678
01:09:26.412 --> 01:09:28.277
You're taller.

679
01:09:28.831 --> 01:09:30.412
Who? You!

680
01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:32.115
- Than what?
- Than me!

681
01:09:32.627 --> 01:09:34.788
I've always been taller than you.

682
01:09:34.879 --> 01:09:39.543
Pippin. everyone knows I'm the tall one.
You're the short one.

683
01:09:40.385 --> 01:09:41.966
Please. merry.

684
01:09:42.053 --> 01:09:45.921
You're what? Three-foot-six? At the most?

685
01:09:46.557 --> 01:09:48.718
Whereas me. I'm pushing 3'7".

686
01:09:51.479 --> 01:09:53.720
3'8"1

687
01:09:55.692 --> 01:09:57.557
three-foot-eight.

688
01:10:00.571 --> 01:10:02.482
You did something.

689
01:10:08.287 --> 01:10:09.868
Pippin:
Merry. don't! Don't drink it!

690
01:10:10.790 --> 01:10:12.326
Merry!

691
01:10:12.417 --> 01:10:14.829
No. treebeard said that you
shouldn't have any.

692
01:10:14.919 --> 01:10:18.958
Merry: I want some!
- It could well be dangerous!

693
01:10:19.048 --> 01:10:21.209
Give me it back. Merry!

694
01:10:23.094 --> 01:10:24.379
What's happening?!

695
01:10:25.263 --> 01:10:26.719
It's got my leg!

696
01:10:27.098 --> 01:10:28.588
Merry!

697
01:10:37.108 --> 01:10:38.314
No!

698
01:10:47.910 --> 01:10:49.616
Pippin: Help!

699
01:10:56.294 --> 01:10:58.205
Treebeard: Away with you.

700
01:10:58.296 --> 01:11:00.127
You should not be waking.

701
01:11:00.631 --> 01:11:05.625
Eat earth. Dig deep. Drink water.

702
01:11:06.179 --> 01:11:08.761
Go to sleep.

703
01:11:09.140 --> 01:11:11.005
Away with you.

704
01:11:11.100 --> 01:11:14.433
Come. the forest is waking up.

705
01:11:14.979 --> 01:11:16.935
It isn't safe.

706
01:11:19.567 --> 01:11:23.526
The trees have grown wild
and dangerous.

707
01:11:23.613 --> 01:11:26.696
Anger festers in their hearts.

708
01:11:27.533 --> 01:11:29.194
Black are their thoughts.

709
01:11:29.285 --> 01:11:31.901
Strong is their hate.

710
01:11:31.996 --> 01:11:34.829
They will harm you if they can.

711
01:11:34.916 --> 01:11:38.579
There are too few of us now.

712
01:11:38.669 --> 01:11:42.708
Too few of us ents left to manage them.

713
01:11:43.341 --> 01:11:46.048
Why are there so few of you
when you have lived so long?

714
01:11:46.135 --> 01:11:49.377
- Are there ent children?
- Bru-ra-hroom_

715
01:11:49.472 --> 01:11:55.183
There have been no entings
for a terrible long count of years.

716
01:11:55.269 --> 01:12:00.559
Why is that?
We lost the entwives.

717
01:12:00.817 --> 01:12:02.273
Oh. I'm sorry.

718
01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:06.353
How did they die? Die? No.

719
01:12:06.447 --> 01:12:09.780
We lost them.

720
01:12:09.867 --> 01:12:15.078
And now we cannot find them.

721
01:12:15.164 --> 01:12:21.410
I don't suppose you've seen entwives
in the shire?

722
01:12:21.504 --> 01:12:24.120
Can't say that I have.

723
01:12:24.632 --> 01:12:26.714
You. pip?

724
01:12:28.135 --> 01:12:30.501
What do they look like?

725
01:12:32.974 --> 01:12:37.638
I don't remember now.

726
01:12:54.036 --> 01:12:57.949
Gandalf: Edoras and the golden hall
of meduseld.

727
01:12:58.749 --> 01:13:01.365
There dwells theoden. king of Rohan...

728
01:13:02.044 --> 01:13:05.002
Whose mind is overthrown.

729
01:13:05.089 --> 01:13:09.378
Saruman's hold over king theoden
is now very strong.

730
01:13:10.052 --> 01:13:13.260
Eowyn: My lord. your son...

731
01:13:13.347 --> 01:13:15.554
He is dead.

732
01:13:17.059 --> 01:13:18.890
My lord?

733
01:13:20.146 --> 01:13:21.306
Uncle?

734
01:13:28.112 --> 01:13:30.398
Will you not go to him?

735
01:13:33.492 --> 01:13:35.949
Will you do nothing?

736
01:13:36.037 --> 01:13:38.153
Be careful what you say.

737
01:13:38.247 --> 01:13:40.408
Do not look for welcome here.

738
01:14:04.482 --> 01:14:08.691
Oh. he must have died
sometime in the night.

739
01:14:08.778 --> 01:14:11.064
What a tragedy for the king...

740
01:14:11.155 --> 01:14:14.147
To lose his only son and heir.

741
01:14:15.326 --> 01:14:19.820
I understand.
His passing is hard to accept.

742
01:14:19.914 --> 01:14:24.908
Especially now that your brother
has deserted you.

743
01:14:25.002 --> 01:14:26.492
Leave me alone. snake!

744
01:14:27.964 --> 01:14:29.625
Oh. but you are alone.

745
01:14:31.258 --> 01:14:36.048
Who knows what you've spoken
to the darkness.

746
01:14:36.138 --> 01:14:39.722
In the bitter watches of the night...

747
01:14:39.809 --> 01:14:43.518
When all your life seems to shrink.

748
01:14:43.604 --> 01:14:47.893
The walls of your bower
closing in about you.

749
01:14:47.984 --> 01:14:52.603
A hutch to trammel some wild thing in.

750
01:14:54.865 --> 01:14:56.730
So fair.

751
01:14:57.994 --> 01:14:59.359
So cold.

752
01:15:01.163 --> 01:15:03.449
Like a morning of pale spring...

753
01:15:03.541 --> 01:15:06.999
Still clinging to winter's chill.

754
01:15:20.766 --> 01:15:23.257
Your words are poison.

755
01:16:55.778 --> 01:16:58.269
You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.

756
01:17:11.502 --> 01:17:12.582
Ah

757
01:17:12.670 --> 01:17:16.504
I cannot allow you before theoden king
so armed. Gandalf greyhame.

758
01:17:18.008 --> 01:17:20.545
By order of grima wormtongue.

759
01:17:37.862 --> 01:17:40.854
Your staff. Hm? Oh.

760
01:17:43.033 --> 01:17:46.525
You would not part an old man
from his walking stick.

761
01:18:05.347 --> 01:18:08.214
My lord. Gandalf the grey is coming.

762
01:18:16.567 --> 01:18:18.182
He's a herald of woe.

763
01:18:18.277 --> 01:18:22.691
The courtesy of your hall
is somewhat lessened of late

764
01:18:23.824 --> 01:18:25.234
theoden king.

765
01:18:25.951 --> 01:18:28.488
He's not welcome.

766
01:18:29.413 --> 01:18:34.703
Why should I welcome you...

767
01:18:35.211 --> 01:18:38.954
(Gandalf stormcrow?

768
01:18:39.048 --> 01:18:42.461
A just question. my liege.

769
01:18:42.551 --> 01:18:45.463
I ate is the hour...

770
01:18:45.554 --> 01:18:49.593
In which this conjurer
chooses to appear.

771
01:18:50.351 --> 01:18:52.467
Lathspell I name him.

772
01:18:52.561 --> 01:18:55.519
I'll news is an ill guest.

773
01:18:55.606 --> 01:19:00.270
Be silent. Keep your forked tongue
behind your teeth.

774
01:19:00.361 --> 01:19:02.352
I have not passed
through fire and death...

775
01:19:02.446 --> 01:19:05.734
To bandy crooked words
with a witless worm.

776
01:19:06.700 --> 01:19:08.861
His staff

777
01:19:08.953 --> 01:19:13.117
I told you to take the wizard's staff.

778
01:19:16.460 --> 01:19:18.416
Thoden

779
01:19:18.963 --> 01:19:21.545
son of thengel...

780
01:19:23.300 --> 01:19:25.666
Too long have you sat
in the shadows.

781
01:19:28.639 --> 01:19:32.006
I would stay still if I were you.

782
01:19:32.101 --> 01:19:34.183
Hearken to me!

783
01:19:39.650 --> 01:19:41.857
I release you...

784
01:19:41.944 --> 01:19:43.935
From the spell.

785
01:19:55.499 --> 01:19:58.536
You have no power here...

786
01:19:58.794 --> 01:20:02.332
Gandalf the grey.

787
01:20:07.761 --> 01:20:12.801
I will draw you. saruman.
as poison is drawn from a wound.

788
01:20:22.234 --> 01:20:23.770
Wait

789
01:20:25.195 --> 01:20:29.029
saruman's voice:
If I go. thoden dies.

790
01:20:29.742 --> 01:20:31.983
You did not kill me.

791
01:20:32.077 --> 01:20:34.318
You will not kill him.

792
01:20:38.208 --> 01:20:39.914
Saruman: Rohan is mine.

793
01:20:41.420 --> 01:20:42.751
Be gone.

794
01:21:27.257 --> 01:21:29.418
I know your face.

795
01:21:33.972 --> 01:21:35.257
Eowyn.

796
01:21:37.559 --> 01:21:38.799
Eowyn.

797
01:21:47.111 --> 01:21:48.271
(Gandalf?

798
01:21:48.821 --> 01:21:51.688
Breathe the free air again. my friend.

799
01:22:05.087 --> 01:22:07.669
Dark have been my dreams of late.

800
01:22:11.802 --> 01:22:15.670
Your fingers would remember
their old strength better...

801
01:22:15.764 --> 01:22:18.722
If they grasped your sword.

802
01:23:03.854 --> 01:23:05.890
Wormtongue: I've only...

803
01:23:05.981 --> 01:23:09.098
Ever served you. my lord.

804
01:23:09.193 --> 01:23:14.233
Your leechcraft would have had me
crawling on all fours like a beast!

805
01:23:15.240 --> 01:23:17.196
Wormtongue:
Send me not from your sight.

806
01:23:19.495 --> 01:23:22.282
Aragorn:
No. my lord! No. my lord.

807
01:23:22.372 --> 01:23:23.612
Let him go.

808
01:23:24.374 --> 01:23:27.537
Enough blood has been spilt
on his account.

809
01:23:36.678 --> 01:23:39.010
Wormtongue: Get out of my way!

810
01:23:41.225 --> 01:23:44.388
Man: Hail. thoden king!

811
01:24:09.044 --> 01:24:11.581
Where is thodred?

812
01:24:14.591 --> 01:24:17.082
Where is my son?

813
01:25:44.348 --> 01:25:46.054
Theoden: Simbelmyn.

814
01:25:51.188 --> 01:25:54.806
Ever has it grown on the tombs
of my forebearers.

815
01:25:58.654 --> 01:26:01.612
Now it shall cover the grave
of my son.

816
01:26:03.742 --> 01:26:07.610
Alas that these evil days
should be mine.

817
01:26:08.372 --> 01:26:12.786
The young perish and the old linger.

818
01:26:13.377 --> 01:26:15.538
That I should live.

819
01:26:15.629 --> 01:26:19.042
To see the last days of my house.

820
01:26:20.258 --> 01:26:24.126
Theodred's death
was not of your making.

821
01:26:27.182 --> 01:26:30.549
No parent should have to bury
their child.

822
01:26:47.285 --> 01:26:49.150
Gandalf: He was strong in life.

823
01:26:50.247 --> 01:26:53.831
His spirit will find its way
to the halls of your fathers.

824
01:27:38.420 --> 01:27:40.331
They had no warning.

825
01:27:40.422 --> 01:27:42.879
They were unarmed.

826
01:27:43.341 --> 01:27:47.380
Now the wild men are moving through
the westfold. burning as they go.

827
01:27:48.305 --> 01:27:50.261
Rick. cot and tree.

828
01:27:50.640 --> 01:27:52.756
Where is mama? Eowyn: Shh

829
01:27:53.643 --> 01:27:57.852
this is but a taste of the terror
that saruman will unleash.

830
01:27:57.939 --> 01:28:02.399
All the more potent for he is driven now
by fear of Sauron.

831
01:28:03.987 --> 01:28:06.979
Ride out and meet him head on.

832
01:28:07.741 --> 01:28:11.233
Draw him away from your women
and children.

833
01:28:11.578 --> 01:28:13.239
You must fight.

834
01:28:13.330 --> 01:28:17.243
You have 2000 good men riding north
as we speak.

835
01:28:17.334 --> 01:28:19.040
Eomer is loyal to you.

836
01:28:19.127 --> 01:28:21.914
His men will return
and fight for their king.

837
01:28:22.005 --> 01:28:25.964
They will be 300 leagues from here
by now.

838
01:28:29.679 --> 01:28:31.840
Eomer cannot help us.

839
01:28:32.474 --> 01:28:34.305
I know what it is you want of me...

840
01:28:34.392 --> 01:28:37.680
But I will not bring further death
to my people.

841
01:28:39.356 --> 01:28:41.062
I will not risk open war.

842
01:28:43.276 --> 01:28:46.689
Open war is upon you.
whether you would risk it or not.

843
01:28:50.909 --> 01:28:52.524
Theoden: When last I looked

844
01:28:52.994 --> 01:28:56.612
theoden. not aragorn.
was king of Rohan.

845
01:29:03.505 --> 01:29:05.746
Then what is the king's decision?

846
01:29:11.346 --> 01:29:12.756
Hama: By order of the king...

847
01:29:12.848 --> 01:29:14.304
The city must empty.

848
01:29:15.475 --> 01:29:18.342
We make for the refuge of helm's deep.

849
01:29:18.645 --> 01:29:22.604
Do not burden yourself with treasures.
Take only what provisions you need.

850
01:29:22.691 --> 01:29:24.272
Gimli: Helm's deep.

851
01:29:24.359 --> 01:29:27.977
They flee to the mountains
when they should stand and fight.

852
01:29:28.071 --> 01:29:30.107
Who will defend them if not their king?

853
01:29:30.198 --> 01:29:32.735
He's only doing what he thinks
is best for his people.

854
01:29:32.826 --> 01:29:34.737
Helm's deep has saved them
in the past.

855
01:29:34.828 --> 01:29:38.787
There is no way out of that ravine.
Thoden is walking into a trap.

856
01:29:38.874 --> 01:29:41.160
He thinks he's leading them to safety.

857
01:29:41.251 --> 01:29:43.458
What they will get is a massacre.

858
01:29:45.005 --> 01:29:47.496
Theoden has a strong will.
but I fear for him.

859
01:29:48.383 --> 01:29:51.750
I fear for the survival of Rohan.

860
01:29:52.178 --> 01:29:55.045
He will need you before the end.
aragorn.

861
01:29:55.515 --> 01:29:58.302
The people of Rohan will need you.

862
01:29:58.685 --> 01:30:01.142
The defenses have to hold.

863
01:30:02.564 --> 01:30:04.304
They will hold.

864
01:30:08.320 --> 01:30:10.652
The grey pilgrim.

865
01:30:10.739 --> 01:30:13.446
That's what they used to call me.

866
01:30:13.533 --> 01:30:18.698
Three hundred lives of men I've walked
this earth. and now I have no time.

867
01:30:20.290 --> 01:30:22.497
With luck. my search will not
be in vain.

868
01:30:23.043 --> 01:30:26.331
Look to my coming at first light
on the fifth day.

869
01:30:27.213 --> 01:30:29.955
At dawn. look to the east.

870
01:30:58.954 --> 01:31:02.321
That horse is half mad. my lord.
There's nothing you can do. Leave him.

871
01:31:41.371 --> 01:31:43.407
His name is brego.

872
01:31:44.916 --> 01:31:46.907
He was my cousin's horse.

873
01:31:47.002 --> 01:31:48.867
Brego.

874
01:32:03.601 --> 01:32:06.058
I have heard of the magic of elves...

875
01:32:06.146 --> 01:32:09.479
But I did not look for it
in a ranger from the north.

876
01:32:10.525 --> 01:32:12.937
You speak as one of their own.

877
01:32:14.738 --> 01:32:17.195
I was raised in rivendell

878
01:32:17.449 --> 01:32:18.985
for a time.

879
01:32:22.287 --> 01:32:24.323
Turn this fellow free

880
01:32:24.956 --> 01:32:27.447
he's seen enough of war.

881
01:32:39.220 --> 01:32:42.087
(Gandalf the white.

882
01:32:42.182 --> 01:32:44.594
(Gandalf the fool!

883
01:32:45.935 --> 01:32:50.178
Does he seek to humble me
with his newfound piety?

884
01:32:51.149 --> 01:32:55.108
Wormtongue: There were three
who followed the wizard

885
01:32:55.528 --> 01:33:00.864
an elf. a dwarf and a man.

886
01:33:01.242 --> 01:33:04.029
You stink of horse.

887
01:33:09.292 --> 01:33:11.157
The man.

888
01:33:13.213 --> 01:33:17.456
- Was he from gondor?
- No. from the north.

889
01:33:17.550 --> 01:33:21.418
One of the dunedain rangers.
I thought he was.

890
01:33:21.513 --> 01:33:23.344
His cloth was poor.

891
01:33:24.265 --> 01:33:29.385
And yet he bore a strange ring.

892
01:33:30.480 --> 01:33:34.064
Two serpents with emerald eyes.

893
01:33:34.150 --> 01:33:40.066
One devouring.
the other crowned with golden flowers.

894
01:33:40.156 --> 01:33:42.112
Saruman: The ring of barahir.

895
01:33:43.076 --> 01:33:46.694
So Gandalf greyhame
thinks he has found isildur's heir.

896
01:33:46.788 --> 01:33:50.201
The lost king of gondor.
He is a fool

897
01:33:50.291 --> 01:33:53.078
the line was broken years ago.

898
01:33:54.504 --> 01:33:55.994
It matters not.

899
01:33:56.089 --> 01:33:58.705
The world of men shall fall

900
01:33:58.800 --> 01:34:00.711
it will begin at edoras.

901
01:34:09.936 --> 01:34:11.892
I am ready. gamling.

902
01:34:11.980 --> 01:34:14.517
Bring my horse.

903
01:34:17.652 --> 01:34:19.017
This is not a defeat.

904
01:34:21.447 --> 01:34:22.653
We will return.

905
01:34:28.121 --> 01:34:30.533
We will return.

906
01:34:53.897 --> 01:34:55.853
You have some skill with a blade.

907
01:35:04.365 --> 01:35:06.481
Women of this country learned long ago:

908
01:35:06.576 --> 01:35:09.283
Those without swords
can still die upon them.

909
01:35:09.370 --> 01:35:11.235
I fear neither death nor pain.

910
01:35:12.498 --> 01:35:14.614
What do you fear. my lady?

911
01:35:18.004 --> 01:35:19.835
A cage.

912
01:35:21.132 --> 01:35:25.000
To stay behind bars until use
and old age accept them.

913
01:35:25.094 --> 01:35:29.087
And all chance of valor has gone
beyond recall or desire.

914
01:35:32.477 --> 01:35:34.513
You're a daughter of kings...

915
01:35:35.772 --> 01:35:39.105
A shieldmaiden of Rohan.

916
01:35:44.364 --> 01:35:46.901
I do not think that would be your fate.

917
01:36:19.941 --> 01:36:23.024
Wormtongue:
Thoden will not stay at edoras.

918
01:36:23.111 --> 01:36:25.318
It's vulnerable. He knows this.

919
01:36:25.405 --> 01:36:28.317
He will expect an attack on the city.

920
01:36:29.659 --> 01:36:32.947
They will flee to helm's deep...

921
01:36:33.037 --> 01:36:35.403
The great fortress of Rohan.

922
01:36:36.666 --> 01:36:41.000
It is a dangerous road to take
through the mountains.

923
01:36:42.463 --> 01:36:44.169
They will be slow.

924
01:36:44.549 --> 01:36:48.963
They will have women and children
with them.

925
01:36:52.849 --> 01:36:55.181
Send out your warg-riders.

926
01:37:09.991 --> 01:37:12.949
Hey. stinker. don't go getting
too far ahead.

927
01:37:13.036 --> 01:37:15.778
Why do you do that? What?

928
01:37:15.872 --> 01:37:18.454
Call him names.
Run him down all the time.

929
01:37:18.875 --> 01:37:20.911
Because.

930
01:37:22.462 --> 01:37:24.623
Because that's what he is. Mr. Frodo.

931
01:37:24.714 --> 01:37:26.955
There's naught left in him
but lies and deceit.

932
01:37:27.383 --> 01:37:30.216
It's the ring he wants.
It's all he cares about.

933
01:37:30.303 --> 01:37:32.635
You have no idea what it did to him _..

934
01:37:32.722 --> 01:37:35.259
What it's still doing to him.

935
01:37:37.477 --> 01:37:39.593
I want to help him. Sam.

936
01:37:39.687 --> 01:37:41.018
Why?

937
01:37:46.319 --> 01:37:49.436
Because I have to believe
he can come back.

938
01:37:53.743 --> 01:37:55.654
You can't save him. Mr. Frodo.

939
01:37:55.745 --> 01:37:58.532
What do you know about it?
Nothing!

940
01:38:05.463 --> 01:38:09.672
I'm sorry. Sam. I don't know
why I said that.

941
01:38:10.510 --> 01:38:11.625
I do.

942
01:38:13.679 --> 01:38:15.544
It's the ring.

943
01:38:16.099 --> 01:38:17.680
You can't take your eyes off it.

944
01:38:18.393 --> 01:38:20.384
I've seen youl.

945
01:38:20.853 --> 01:38:24.687
You're not eating. You barely sleep.

946
01:38:26.442 --> 01:38:28.728
It's taken hold of you. Mr. Frodo.

947
01:38:28.820 --> 01:38:31.653
- You have to fight it.
- I know what I have to do. Sam.

948
01:38:31.739 --> 01:38:34.697
The ring was entrusted to me.
It's my task.

949
01:38:34.784 --> 01:38:36.570
Mine! My own!

950
01:38:37.412 --> 01:38:39.573
Can't you hear yourself?

951
01:38:39.664 --> 01:38:41.370
Don't you know who you sound like?

952
01:38:51.634 --> 01:38:53.795
Gollum: We wants it.

953
01:38:53.886 --> 01:38:56.673
We needs it.

954
01:38:56.764 --> 01:39:01.679
Must have the precious.

955
01:39:01.769 --> 01:39:05.261
They stole it from us.

956
01:39:05.356 --> 01:39:08.814
Sneaky little hobbitses.

957
01:39:08.901 --> 01:39:12.860
Wicked. Tricksy. False.

958
01:39:12.947 --> 01:39:16.314
Smeagol: No. Not master.

959
01:39:16.409 --> 01:39:20.322
Gollum: Yes. precious. False.

960
01:39:20.413 --> 01:39:24.952
They will cheat you. hurt you. lie!

961
01:39:26.085 --> 01:39:28.576
Smeagol: Master's my friend.

962
01:39:28.671 --> 01:39:33.836
You don't have any friends.
Nobody likes you.

963
01:39:35.052 --> 01:39:37.589
Not listening. I'm not listening.

964
01:39:37.680 --> 01:39:41.719
You're a liar and a thief.

965
01:39:42.351 --> 01:39:43.932
No

966
01:39:44.854 --> 01:39:47.721
Murderer.

967
01:39:50.193 --> 01:39:51.273
Go away.

968
01:39:51.360 --> 01:39:53.772
Go away?

969
01:39:55.781 --> 01:40:01.158
I hate you.

970
01:40:01.454 --> 01:40:04.787
Where would you be without me?
Gollum. Gollum

971
01:40:04.874 --> 01:40:06.785
I saved us.

972
01:40:06.876 --> 01:40:11.461
It was me. We survived because of me.

973
01:40:12.673 --> 01:40:16.257
Not anymore.

974
01:40:17.595 --> 01:40:19.176
What did you say?

975
01:40:21.224 --> 01:40:25.092
Master looks after us now.

976
01:40:25.186 --> 01:40:28.724
We don't need you.

977
01:40:29.440 --> 01:40:31.055
What?

978
01:40:31.150 --> 01:40:32.981
I eave now.

979
01:40:33.069 --> 01:40:36.937
And never come back.

980
01:40:37.031 --> 01:40:38.111
No

981
01:40:38.616 --> 01:40:42.825
I eave now and never come back

982
01:40:45.414 --> 01:40:51.330
I eave now and never come back!

983
01:41:03.307 --> 01:41:06.049
We told him to go away.

984
01:41:06.143 --> 01:41:09.180
And away he goes. precious.

985
01:41:09.272 --> 01:41:11.354
Gone! Gone! Gone!

986
01:41:11.440 --> 01:41:13.271
Smeagol is free!

987
01:41:18.197 --> 01:41:19.733
Smeagol: Look.

988
01:41:19.824 --> 01:41:24.363
Look. See what smeagol finds?

989
01:41:33.879 --> 01:41:35.335
They are young.

990
01:41:35.423 --> 01:41:38.039
They are tender. They are nice.

991
01:41:38.134 --> 01:41:41.718
Yes. they are. Eat them. Eat them!

992
01:41:44.473 --> 01:41:46.009
You'll make him sick. you will...

993
01:41:47.226 --> 01:41:49.467
Behaving like that.

994
01:41:51.814 --> 01:41:54.601
There's only one way to eat
a brace of coneys.

995
01:41:58.779 --> 01:42:00.360
What's it doing?

996
01:42:01.073 --> 01:42:03.780
Stupid. fat hobbit.

997
01:42:03.868 --> 01:42:06.154
It ruins it.

998
01:42:06.245 --> 01:42:09.908
What's to ruin? There's hardly any meat
on them.

999
01:42:14.045 --> 01:42:16.627
What we need is a few good taters.

1000
01:42:17.506 --> 01:42:20.589
What's taters. precious?

1001
01:42:20.676 --> 01:42:22.507
What's taters? Fh?

1002
01:42:22.595 --> 01:42:24.335
Po-ta-toes.

1003
01:42:24.680 --> 01:42:27.922
Boil them. mash them.
stick them in a stew.

1004
01:42:29.435 --> 01:42:34.930
Lovely. big. golden chips
with a nice piece of fried fish.

1005
01:42:36.233 --> 01:42:38.144
Even you couldn't say no to that.

1006
01:42:38.527 --> 01:42:40.688
Oh. yes. we could.

1007
01:42:40.780 --> 01:42:44.318
Spoil a nice fish.

1008
01:42:45.618 --> 01:42:48.280
Give it to us raw.

1009
01:42:48.371 --> 01:42:51.488
And wriggling.

1010
01:42:51.582 --> 01:42:54.745
You keep nasty chips.

1011
01:42:55.670 --> 01:42:57.752
You're hopeless.

1012
01:43:10.267 --> 01:43:11.757
Mr Frodo?

1013
01:43:29.662 --> 01:43:32.369
Sam: Who are they?
Smeagol:- Wicked men.

1014
01:43:32.456 --> 01:43:34.947
Servants of Sauron.

1015
01:43:35.751 --> 01:43:37.992
They are called to mordor.

1016
01:43:38.087 --> 01:43:41.204
The dark one is gathering all armies
to him.

1017
01:43:41.298 --> 01:43:44.506
It won't be long now.
He will soon be ready.

1018
01:43:46.095 --> 01:43:49.758
- Ready to do what?
- To make his war.

1019
01:43:49.849 --> 01:43:55.094
The last war that will cover
all the world in shadow.

1020
01:43:55.354 --> 01:43:57.219
We've got to get moving. Come on. Sam.

1021
01:43:58.566 --> 01:43:59.806
Mr. Frodo.

1022
01:44:00.317 --> 01:44:01.932
I ook.

1023
01:44:05.614 --> 01:44:07.900
It's an oliphaunt.

1024
01:44:16.125 --> 01:44:19.117
No one at home will believe this.

1025
01:44:30.264 --> 01:44:32.129
Smeagol?

1026
01:45:12.473 --> 01:45:14.964
We've lingered here too long.

1027
01:45:17.978 --> 01:45:19.309
Come on. Sam.

1028
01:45:31.367 --> 01:45:32.652
No!

1029
01:45:32.743 --> 01:45:35.450
Wait! We're innocent travelers!

1030
01:45:37.206 --> 01:45:42.326
There are no travelers in this land.
Only servants of the dark tower.

1031
01:45:42.419 --> 01:45:45.331
We are bound to an errand of secrecy.

1032
01:45:46.715 --> 01:45:50.128
Those that claim to oppose the enemy
would do well not to hinder us.

1033
01:45:50.219 --> 01:45:52.335
The enemy?

1034
01:45:54.390 --> 01:45:57.882
His sense of duty was no less
than yours. I deem.

1035
01:46:00.354 --> 01:46:02.470
You wonder what his name is.

1036
01:46:03.983 --> 01:46:06.224
Where he came from.

1037
01:46:08.237 --> 01:46:10.649
And if he was really evil at heart.

1038
01:46:12.324 --> 01:46:15.782
What lies or threats led him
on this long march from home.

1039
01:46:17.371 --> 01:46:19.862
If he would not rather have stayed there...

1040
01:46:22.042 --> 01:46:23.578
In peace.

1041
01:46:27.131 --> 01:46:30.214
War will make corpses of us all.

1042
01:46:30.301 --> 01:46:32.383
Bind their hands.

1043
01:46:46.360 --> 01:46:49.193
Gimli: It's true. you don't see
many dwarf women.

1044
01:46:49.279 --> 01:46:52.988
And in fact. they are so alike
in voice and appearance...

1045
01:46:53.075 --> 01:46:56.317
That they're often mistaken
for dwarf men.

1046
01:46:56.662 --> 01:46:58.573
It's the beards.

1047
01:46:58.831 --> 01:47:00.947
This. in turn. has given rise
to the belief

1048
01:47:01.041 --> 01:47:03.874
that there are no dwarf women

1049
01:47:04.128 --> 01:47:08.371
and that dwarves just spring out
of holes in the ground...

1050
01:47:10.050 --> 01:47:11.460
Which is. of course. ridiculous.

1051
01:47:18.016 --> 01:47:20.348
Gimli:
It's all right. Nobody panic.

1052
01:47:20.728 --> 01:47:22.719
That was deliberate.
It was deliberate

1053
01:47:24.648 --> 01:47:28.482
I haven't seen my niece smile
for a long time.

1054
01:47:28.777 --> 01:47:31.564
She was a girl when they brought
her father back dead.

1055
01:47:31.655 --> 01:47:34.021
Cut down by orcs.

1056
01:47:34.116 --> 01:47:37.153
She watched her mother
succumb to grief.

1057
01:47:37.786 --> 01:47:42.530
Then she was left alone.
to tend her king in growing fear.

1058
01:47:42.624 --> 01:47:47.209
Doomed to wait upon an old man.
who should have loved her as a father.

1059
01:47:57.181 --> 01:47:59.593
Gimli.

1060
01:47:59.683 --> 01:48:01.844
No. I couldn't.

1061
01:48:01.935 --> 01:48:03.800
I really couldn't.

1062
01:48:08.317 --> 01:48:09.978
I made some stew.

1063
01:48:10.068 --> 01:48:13.401
It isn't much. but it's hot.

1064
01:48:21.205 --> 01:48:23.241
Thank you.

1065
01:48:43.769 --> 01:48:46.306
- It's good.
- Really?

1066
01:48:50.275 --> 01:48:53.642
My uncle told me a strange thing.

1067
01:48:54.947 --> 01:48:59.031
He said that you rode to war
with thengel. my grandfather.

1068
01:48:59.451 --> 01:49:02.033
But he must be mistaken.

1069
01:49:02.120 --> 01:49:06.580
King theoden has a good memory.
He was only a small child at the time.

1070
01:49:07.709 --> 01:49:10.951
Then you must be at least 60.

1071
01:49:13.006 --> 01:49:14.587
Seventy?

1072
01:49:15.008 --> 01:49:16.669
But you cannot be 80!

1073
01:49:20.013 --> 01:49:21.378
Eighty-seven.

1074
01:49:24.476 --> 01:49:26.592
You are one of the diunedain.

1075
01:49:27.646 --> 01:49:30.763
A descendant of numenor.
blessed with long life.

1076
01:49:31.984 --> 01:49:34.600
It was said that your race
had passed into legend.

1077
01:49:35.279 --> 01:49:37.065
There are few of us left

1078
01:49:37.155 --> 01:49:40.022
the northern kingdom
was destroyed long ago.

1079
01:49:40.784 --> 01:49:44.197
I'm sorry. Please. eat.

1080
01:49:58.844 --> 01:50:03.008
Arwen: The light of the evenstar
does not wax and wane.

1081
01:50:03.765 --> 01:50:07.223
It is mine to give to whom I will.

1082
01:50:09.021 --> 01:50:11.433
Like my heart.

1083
01:50:12.858 --> 01:50:15.600
Go fo sleep.

1084
01:50:15.694 --> 01:50:18.231
I am asleep.

1085
01:50:24.703 --> 01:50:26.659
This is a dream.

1086
01:50:28.874 --> 01:50:32.082
Then it is a good dream.

1087
01:50:44.097 --> 01:50:46.179
Sleep.

1088
01:51:49.162 --> 01:51:51.073
Arwen.

1089
01:52:40.547 --> 01:52:42.378
Eowyn: Where is she?

1090
01:52:43.550 --> 01:52:45.962
The woman who gave you that Jewel.

1091
01:52:49.306 --> 01:52:52.048
Elrond: Our time here is ending.

1092
01:52:52.726 --> 01:52:55.308
Arwen's time is ending.

1093
01:52:56.021 --> 01:52:57.352
Let her go.

1094
01:52:57.439 --> 01:52:59.521
Let her take the ship into the west.

1095
01:52:59.608 --> 01:53:02.771
Let her bear away her love for you
to the undying lands.

1096
01:53:02.861 --> 01:53:04.692
There it will be ever green.

1097
01:53:06.198 --> 01:53:08.564
But never more than memory.

1098
01:53:09.826 --> 01:53:12.943
I will not leave my daughter here
to die.

1099
01:53:13.038 --> 01:53:16.747
- She stays because she still has hope.
- She stays for you.

1100
01:53:16.833 --> 01:53:19.199
She belongs with her people.

1101
01:54:07.509 --> 01:54:09.340
Why are you saying this?

1102
01:54:10.929 --> 01:54:14.092
I am mortal you are elf-kind.

1103
01:54:15.559 --> 01:54:18.221
It was a dream. arwen.

1104
01:54:18.645 --> 01:54:20.010
Nothing more.

1105
01:54:21.398 --> 01:54:24.606
I don't believe you.

1106
01:54:33.618 --> 01:54:35.449
This belongs to you.

1107
01:54:38.206 --> 01:54:39.787
It was a gift.

1108
01:54:42.460 --> 01:54:43.950
Keep it.

1109
01:54:46.464 --> 01:54:47.670
Eowyn: My lord?

1110
01:54:50.468 --> 01:54:55.053
She is sailing to the undying lands
with all that is left of her kin.

1111
01:55:18.496 --> 01:55:19.986
What is it?

1112
01:55:21.499 --> 01:55:23.535
- Hama?
- I'm not sure.

1113
01:55:40.101 --> 01:55:42.183
Wargs!

1114
01:55:54.699 --> 01:55:56.360
A scout!

1115
01:56:02.707 --> 01:56:05.198
- What is it? What do you see?
- Warg! We're under attack!

1116
01:56:06.544 --> 01:56:08.751
(Set them out of here!

1117
01:56:13.510 --> 01:56:15.546
All riders to the head of the column.

1118
01:56:16.221 --> 01:56:18.257
Gimli:
Come on. Get me up here. I'm a rider.

1119
01:56:18.348 --> 01:56:20.134
Come on!

1120
01:56:31.945 --> 01:56:34.436
You must lead the people
to helm's deep. and make haste.

1121
01:56:34.531 --> 01:56:36.067
- I can fight.
- No!

1122
01:56:38.743 --> 01:56:40.825
You must do this. for me.

1123
01:56:42.831 --> 01:56:44.412
Follow me! Hyah!

1124
01:56:47.919 --> 01:56:52.288
Gimli: Forward. I mean. charge forward.
Eowyn: Make for the lower ground!

1125
01:56:52.382 --> 01:56:55.089
- That's it! Go on!
- Stay together!

1126
01:58:07.332 --> 01:58:09.618
Gimli:
Bring your pretty face to my ax.

1127
01:58:12.420 --> 01:58:14.001
That one counts as mine!

1128
01:58:30.688 --> 01:58:32.303
Stinking creature.

1129
01:59:59.569 --> 02:00:01.434
Aragorn!

1130
02:00:06.159 --> 02:00:07.615
Aragorn?

1131
02:00:21.633 --> 02:00:24.591
Tell me what happened
and I will ease your passing.

1132
02:00:24.677 --> 02:00:26.133
He's

1133
02:00:26.721 --> 02:00:28.302
dead.

1134
02:00:28.973 --> 02:00:31.840
He took a little tumble off the cliff

1135
02:00:35.480 --> 02:00:36.765
you lie.

1136
02:01:10.682 --> 02:01:12.297
(Get the wounded on horses.

1137
02:01:13.601 --> 02:01:16.764
The wolves of isengard will return.

1138
02:01:17.188 --> 02:01:19.304
I eave the dead.

1139
02:01:26.698 --> 02:01:28.188
Come.

1140
02:01:38.376 --> 02:01:40.037
Woman 1: At last!
Woman 2: Helm's deep.

1141
02:01:40.128 --> 02:01:43.040
Woman 3:
There it is. helm's deep.

1142
02:01:45.592 --> 02:01:47.423
Woman 4: We're safel

1143
02:01:48.928 --> 02:01:51.840
we're safe. my lady.

1144
02:01:51.931 --> 02:01:53.171
Thank you.

1145
02:02:37.518 --> 02:02:38.974
Freda: Mama! Morwen: Eothain!

1146
02:02:39.062 --> 02:02:40.643
Fredal

1147
02:02:46.402 --> 02:02:49.235
- Where is the rest?
- This is all we could save. my lady.

1148
02:02:53.076 --> 02:02:54.441
Take it to the caves.

1149
02:02:54.535 --> 02:02:57.402
Man: Make way for the king.

1150
02:02:59.290 --> 02:03:02.248
Gamling: Make way for theoden.
Make way for the king.

1151
02:03:10.134 --> 02:03:13.877
So few. So few of you have returned.

1152
02:03:16.641 --> 02:03:18.927
Our people are safe.

1153
02:03:20.269 --> 02:03:22.806
We have paid for it with many lives.

1154
02:03:23.648 --> 02:03:25.184
Gimli: My lady.

1155
02:03:28.903 --> 02:03:31.189
Lord aragorn...

1156
02:03:31.280 --> 02:03:32.565
Where is he?

1157
02:03:34.575 --> 02:03:36.111
He fell

1158
02:03:58.808 --> 02:04:01.800
Draw all our forces behind the wall.

1159
02:04:01.894 --> 02:04:04.852
Bar the gate.
And set a watch on the surround.

1160
02:04:05.106 --> 02:04:08.223
Gamling: What of those who cannot
fight. my lord? The women and children?

1161
02:04:08.317 --> 02:04:10.979
Theoden:
Get them into the caves.

1162
02:04:11.863 --> 02:04:16.698
Saruman"s arm will have grown long
indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.

1163
02:04:18.745 --> 02:04:22.203
Wormtongue:
Helm's deep has one weakness.

1164
02:04:22.290 --> 02:04:24.702
Its outer wall is solid rock

1165
02:04:24.792 --> 02:04:27.955
but for a small culvert
at its base.

1166
02:04:28.045 --> 02:04:30.878
Which is little more than a drain.

1167
02:04:33.718 --> 02:04:37.927
How? How can fire undo stone?

1168
02:04:38.014 --> 02:04:42.599
What kind of device
could bring down the wall?

1169
02:04:46.230 --> 02:04:50.269
Saruman: If the wall is breached.
helm's deep will fall.

1170
02:04:50.359 --> 02:04:53.943
Even if it is breached. it would take
a number beyond reckoning...

1171
02:04:54.030 --> 02:04:56.692
Thousands. to storm the keep.

1172
02:04:56.783 --> 02:04:58.273
Saruman: Tens of thousands.

1173
02:04:58.367 --> 02:05:02.531
Wormtongue:
But. my lord. there is no such force.

1174
02:05:14.425 --> 02:05:17.542
A new power is rising.

1175
02:05:17.637 --> 02:05:20.674
Its victory is at hand.

1176
02:05:26.354 --> 02:05:28.436
This night...

1177
02:05:28.856 --> 02:05:33.225
The land will be stained
with the blood of Rohan!

1178
02:05:33.319 --> 02:05:36.732
March to helm's deep!

1179
02:05:36.823 --> 02:05:40.361
I eave none alive!

1180
02:05:42.870 --> 02:05:45.361
To war!

1181
02:05:49.293 --> 02:05:53.753
There will be no dawn for men.

1182
02:06:10.940 --> 02:06:13.022
I ook. There's smoke to the south.

1183
02:06:13.109 --> 02:06:16.397
There is always smoke rising...

1184
02:06:16.487 --> 02:06:20.355
From isengard these days.

1185
02:06:20.616 --> 02:06:22.277
Isengard?

1186
02:06:22.368 --> 02:06:24.279
Treebeard: There was a time

1187
02:06:24.620 --> 02:06:28.204
when saruman would walk in my woods.

1188
02:06:28.291 --> 02:06:31.658
But now he has a mind of metal

1189
02:06:32.336 --> 02:06:34.793
and wheels.

1190
02:06:35.548 --> 02:06:40.087
He no longer cares for growing things.

1191
02:06:40.177 --> 02:06:42.008
What is it?

1192
02:06:47.018 --> 02:06:49.259
It's saruman's army.

1193
02:06:49.353 --> 02:06:50.968
The war has started.

1194
02:07:29.268 --> 02:07:33.637
Arwen: May the grace of the valar
protect you.

1195
02:08:05.930 --> 02:08:07.795
Brego.

1196
02:08:33.916 --> 02:08:35.076
Elrond: Arwen.

1197
02:08:44.969 --> 02:08:46.755
I have made my choice.

1198
02:08:53.185 --> 02:08:56.052
He is not coming back.

1199
02:08:57.481 --> 02:09:00.814
Why do you linger here
when there is no hope?

1200
02:09:01.736 --> 02:09:04.728
There is still hope.

1201
02:09:08.868 --> 02:09:12.656
If aragorn survives this war.
you will still be parted.

1202
02:09:16.042 --> 02:09:19.034
If Sauron is defeated
and aragorn made king...

1203
02:09:19.128 --> 02:09:21.710
And all that you hope for
comes true

1204
02:09:21.797 --> 02:09:26.541
you will still have to taste
the bitterness of mortality.

1205
02:09:26.844 --> 02:09:29.881
Whether by the sword
or the slow decay of time...

1206
02:09:29.972 --> 02:09:32.930
Aragorn will die.

1207
02:09:35.770 --> 02:09:38.386
And there will be no comfort
for you...

1208
02:09:38.481 --> 02:09:42.724
No comfort to ease the pain
of his passing.

1209
02:09:45.529 --> 02:09:48.316
He will come fo death

1210
02:09:51.160 --> 02:09:55.870
in glory undimmed before
the breaking of the world.

1211
02:10:04.965 --> 02:10:08.924
But you. my daughter...

1212
02:10:09.720 --> 02:10:14.805
You will linger on in darkness
and in doubt

1213
02:10:14.892 --> 02:10:19.010
as nightfall in winter
that comes without a star

1214
02:10:21.398 --> 02:10:23.855
here you will dwell...

1215
02:10:23.943 --> 02:10:28.903
Bound to your grief
under the fading trees...

1216
02:10:30.616 --> 02:10:32.652
Until all the world is changed...

1217
02:10:32.743 --> 02:10:37.282
And the long years of your life
are utterly spent.

1218
02:10:45.840 --> 02:10:47.000
Arwen.

1219
02:10:53.639 --> 02:10:55.925
There is nothing for you here...

1220
02:10:56.600 --> 02:10:58.682
Only death.

1221
02:12:32.112 --> 02:12:35.775
Galadriel:
The power of the enemy is growing.

1222
02:12:35.866 --> 02:12:38.573
Sauron will use his puppet.
saruman.

1223
02:12:38.661 --> 02:12:42.153
To destroy the people of Rohan.

1224
02:12:44.208 --> 02:12:47.871
Isengard has been unleashed.

1225
02:12:52.174 --> 02:12:55.541
The eye of Sauron now turns
to gondor

1226
02:12:56.679 --> 02:12:59.716
the last free kingdom of men.

1227
02:12:59.807 --> 02:13:04.221
His war on this country
will come swiftly.

1228
02:13:07.940 --> 02:13:11.103
He senses the ring is close.

1229
02:13:11.193 --> 02:13:14.731
The strength of the ring-bearer
is failing.

1230
02:13:14.822 --> 02:13:18.906
In his heart. Frodo begins
to understand.

1231
02:13:20.452 --> 02:13:24.365
The quest will claim his life.

1232
02:13:24.456 --> 02:13:26.663
You know this.

1233
02:13:27.251 --> 02:13:30.084
You have foreseen it

1234
02:13:32.214 --> 02:13:35.672
it is the risk we all took.

1235
02:13:40.055 --> 02:13:44.264
In the gathering dark. the will
of the ring grows strong.

1236
02:13:45.436 --> 02:13:49.896
It works hard now to find its way back
into the hands of men.

1237
02:13:49.982 --> 02:13:55.568
Men. who are so easily seduced
by its power.

1238
02:13:55.654 --> 02:13:59.317
The young captain of gondor
has but to extend his hand.

1239
02:13:59.408 --> 02:14:03.526
Lake the ring for his own.
and the world will fall.

1240
02:14:05.956 --> 02:14:07.821
It is close how.

1241
02:14:07.916 --> 02:14:12.205
So close to achieving its goal.

1242
02:14:15.299 --> 02:14:19.008
For Sauron will have dominion
over all life on this earth

1243
02:14:19.094 --> 02:14:23.258
even unto the ending
of the world.

1244
02:14:25.100 --> 02:14:27.011
The time of the elves

1245
02:14:27.102 --> 02:14:29.058
is over.

1246
02:14:29.897 --> 02:14:33.481
Do we leave middle-earth
to its fate?

1247
02:14:35.444 --> 02:14:38.686
Do we let them stand alone?

1248
02:14:43.327 --> 02:14:44.692
What news?

1249
02:14:44.787 --> 02:14:47.699
Our scouts report saruman
has attacked Rohan

1250
02:14:47.790 --> 02:14:50.702
theoden's people have fled
to helm's deep.

1251
02:14:50.793 --> 02:14:54.911
But we must look to our own borders.
Faramir. orcs are on the move.

1252
02:14:55.005 --> 02:14:57.462
Sauron is marshaling an army.

1253
02:14:57.800 --> 02:14:59.961
Easterlings and southrons
are at the black gate

1254
02:15:00.052 --> 02:15:03.510
- how many?
- Some thousands. More come every day.

1255
02:15:04.598 --> 02:15:08.216
- Who's covering the river to the north?
- We pulled 500 men at osgiliath.

1256
02:15:08.310 --> 02:15:11.393
If their city is attacked.
we won't hold it.

1257
02:15:13.524 --> 02:15:15.731
Faramir:
Saruman attacks from isengard.

1258
02:15:15.818 --> 02:15:18.560
Sauron from mordor.

1259
02:15:19.863 --> 02:15:23.151
The fight will come to men
on both fronts

1260
02:15:23.242 --> 02:15:25.028
ggondor is weak.

1261
02:15:25.119 --> 02:15:28.282
Sauron will strike us soon.

1262
02:15:29.039 --> 02:15:30.870
And he will strike hard.

1263
02:15:31.333 --> 02:15:35.417
He knows now we do not have
the strength to repel him.

1264
02:15:49.351 --> 02:15:51.592
My men tell me that you are orc spies.

1265
02:15:51.687 --> 02:15:54.520
Spies? Now wait just a minute.

1266
02:15:54.606 --> 02:15:56.892
Well. if you're not spies.
then who are you?

1267
02:16:03.782 --> 02:16:05.522
Speak.

1268
02:16:06.618 --> 02:16:09.234
We are hobbits of the shire.

1269
02:16:09.580 --> 02:16:12.572
Frodo Baggins is my name.
and this is samwise gamgee.

1270
02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:14.581
Your bodyguard?

1271
02:16:14.668 --> 02:16:16.499
His gardener.

1272
02:16:17.087 --> 02:16:19.078
And where is your skulking friend?

1273
02:16:20.591 --> 02:16:22.923
That gangrel creature.

1274
02:16:23.260 --> 02:16:25.216
He had an ill-favored look.

1275
02:16:26.930 --> 02:16:28.841
There was no other.

1276
02:16:32.936 --> 02:16:35.268
We set out from rivendell
with seven companions.

1277
02:16:38.609 --> 02:16:41.692
One we lost in Moria

1278
02:16:42.779 --> 02:16:44.315
two were my kin...

1279
02:16:44.406 --> 02:16:48.240
A dwarf there was also.
And an elf and two men.

1280
02:16:48.327 --> 02:16:52.286
Aragorn. son of arathorn.
and Boromir of gondor.

1281
02:16:57.294 --> 02:16:59.034
You're a friend of Boromir?

1282
02:17:01.465 --> 02:17:02.955
Yes

1283
02:17:04.051 --> 02:17:05.131
for my part.

1284
02:17:11.642 --> 02:17:14.600
It will grieve you then to learn
that he is dead.

1285
02:17:16.647 --> 02:17:18.137
Dead?

1286
02:17:18.232 --> 02:17:20.314
How? When?

1287
02:17:20.567 --> 02:17:23.229
As one of his companions.
I'd hoped you would tell me.

1288
02:17:23.529 --> 02:17:27.363
If something has happened to Boromir.
we would have you tell us.

1289
02:17:30.118 --> 02:17:36.660
His horn washed up upon the riverbank.
about six days past.

1290
02:17:36.750 --> 02:17:39.867
It was cloven in two.

1291
02:17:41.547 --> 02:17:44.960
But more than this. I know it in my heart.

1292
02:17:47.010 --> 02:17:48.796
He was my brother.

1293
02:18:37.644 --> 02:18:40.727
Men: Boromir!

1294
02:18:41.231 --> 02:18:43.096
Boromir!

1295
02:18:47.362 --> 02:18:51.150
This city was once the Jewel
of our kingdom.

1296
02:18:51.241 --> 02:18:54.984
A place of light and beauty and music.

1297
02:18:55.078 --> 02:18:57.444
And so it shall be once more!

1298
02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:02.707
I et the armies of mordor know this:

1299
02:19:02.794 --> 02:19:07.208
Never again will the land of my people
fall into enemy hands.

1300
02:19:11.011 --> 02:19:16.677
This city of osgiliath
has been reclaimed for gondor!

1301
02:19:17.059 --> 02:19:22.011
- For gondor!
- For gondor!

1302
02:19:30.739 --> 02:19:33.526
Good speech. Nice and short.

1303
02:19:33.617 --> 02:19:36.575
Leaves more time for drinking!

1304
02:19:36.870 --> 02:19:41.113
Break out the ale! These men are thirsty!

1305
02:19:44.586 --> 02:19:46.793
Remember today. little brother.

1306
02:19:46.880 --> 02:19:49.917
Today. life is good.

1307
02:19:54.096 --> 02:19:55.677
What?

1308
02:19:56.056 --> 02:19:57.512
He's here.

1309
02:20:00.727 --> 02:20:03.810
- Moment of peace. can he not give us that?
Denethor: Where is he?

1310
02:20:03.897 --> 02:20:07.389
Where is gondor's finest?
Where's my first-born?

1311
02:20:07.943 --> 02:20:09.649
Father!

1312
02:20:14.491 --> 02:20:16.903
They say you vanquished the enemy
almost single-handedly.

1313
02:20:16.993 --> 02:20:20.451
They exaggerate.
The victory belongs to faramir also.

1314
02:20:21.915 --> 02:20:24.827
But for faramir. this city
would still be standing.

1315
02:20:25.627 --> 02:20:27.959
Were you not entrusted to protect it?

1316
02:20:28.046 --> 02:20:30.162
I would have done.
but our numbers were too few.

1317
02:20:30.257 --> 02:20:31.997
Oh. too few.

1318
02:20:32.509 --> 02:20:34.875
You let the enemy walk in
and take it on a whim.

1319
02:20:37.097 --> 02:20:40.214
Always you cast a poor reflection on me.

1320
02:20:40.308 --> 02:20:42.640
That is not my intent.

1321
02:20:42.728 --> 02:20:46.516
You give him no credit.
and yet he tries to do your will.

1322
02:20:49.901 --> 02:20:52.859
- He loves you. father.
- Do not trouble me with faramir.

1323
02:20:52.946 --> 02:20:55.779
I know his uses. and they are few.

1324
02:20:55.866 --> 02:20:59.529
We have more urgent things to speak of.

1325
02:21:00.704 --> 02:21:03.161
Elrond of rivendell has called a meeting.

1326
02:21:03.248 --> 02:21:06.206
He will not say why.
but I have guessed its purpose.

1327
02:21:06.293 --> 02:21:10.127
It is rumored that the weapon
of the enemy has been found.

1328
02:21:12.340 --> 02:21:14.626
The one ring.

1329
02:21:17.387 --> 02:21:22.097
- Isildur's bane.
- It has fallen into the hands of the elves.

1330
02:21:22.184 --> 02:21:25.893
Everyone will try to claim it:
Men. dwarves. wizards.

1331
02:21:25.979 --> 02:21:30.143
We cannot let that happen.
This thing must come to gondor.

1332
02:21:31.943 --> 02:21:34.650
- Gondor.
- It's dangerous. I know.

1333
02:21:34.738 --> 02:21:38.526
Ever the ring will seek to corrupt
the hearts of lesser men.

1334
02:21:38.617 --> 02:21:42.656
But you. you are strong.
And our need is great.

1335
02:21:42.746 --> 02:21:48.116
It is our blood which is being spilled.
our people who are dying.

1336
02:21:48.210 --> 02:21:53.375
Sauron is biding his time.
He's massing fresh armies.

1337
02:21:53.465 --> 02:21:55.046
He will return

1338
02:21:55.133 --> 02:21:58.967
and when he does.
we will be powerless to stop him.

1339
02:21:59.054 --> 02:22:01.636
You must go.

1340
02:22:02.808 --> 02:22:04.924
Bring me back this mighty gift.

1341
02:22:05.769 --> 02:22:11.184
No. My place is here with my people.
Not in rivendell.

1342
02:22:11.441 --> 02:22:15.150
- Would you deny your own father?
- If there is need to go to rivendell...

1343
02:22:15.237 --> 02:22:18.274
Send me in his stead. You?

1344
02:22:19.449 --> 02:22:21.405
Oh. I see.

1345
02:22:21.493 --> 02:22:25.736
A chance for faramir. captain of gondor.
to show his quality.

1346
02:22:26.164 --> 02:22:28.200
I think not.

1347
02:22:28.291 --> 02:22:31.249
I trust this mission only to your brother.

1348
02:22:31.336 --> 02:22:34.294
The one who will not fail me.

1349
02:22:51.439 --> 02:22:54.602
Remember today. little brother.

1350
02:23:12.961 --> 02:23:14.952
Man: Captain faramir!

1351
02:23:16.214 --> 02:23:18.330
We found the third one.

1352
02:23:29.853 --> 02:23:31.844
You must come with me. Now.

1353
02:23:43.074 --> 02:23:44.189
Down there.

1354
02:23:59.090 --> 02:24:01.957
To enter the forbidden pool
bears the penalty of death.

1355
02:24:12.562 --> 02:24:14.052
They wait for my command.

1356
02:24:19.569 --> 02:24:20.649
Shall I shoot?

1357
02:24:21.905 --> 02:24:24.942
The rock and pool
is nice and cool

1358
02:24:25.033 --> 02:24:26.898
so juicy sweet

1359
02:24:27.577 --> 02:24:30.569
our only wish to catch a fish

1360
02:24:30.664 --> 02:24:33.406
so juicy sweet

1361
02:24:40.423 --> 02:24:41.788
Wait

1362
02:24:43.301 --> 02:24:46.134
this creature is bound to me.

1363
02:24:46.763 --> 02:24:48.674
And I to him.

1364
02:24:51.935 --> 02:24:53.266
He is our guide.

1365
02:24:57.983 --> 02:24:59.439
Please

1366
02:24:59.526 --> 02:25:01.437
let me go down to him.

1367
02:25:12.706 --> 02:25:14.367
Smeagol.

1368
02:25:15.375 --> 02:25:17.616
Master is here.

1369
02:25:18.795 --> 02:25:19.955
Come. smeagol.

1370
02:25:22.799 --> 02:25:25.461
Trust master come.

1371
02:25:28.638 --> 02:25:32.472
We must go now?

1372
02:25:32.809 --> 02:25:36.301
Smeagol. you must trust master.

1373
02:25:36.396 --> 02:25:37.806
Follow me. Come on.

1374
02:25:39.024 --> 02:25:40.639
Come.

1375
02:25:43.153 --> 02:25:44.313
Come. smeagol.

1376
02:25:44.821 --> 02:25:46.903
Nice smeagol. That's it.

1377
02:25:47.407 --> 02:25:48.943
Come on.

1378
02:25:53.329 --> 02:25:55.035
Don't hurt him!

1379
02:25:55.123 --> 02:25:57.956
Smeagol. don't struggle.
Smeagol. listen to me.

1380
02:25:58.043 --> 02:25:59.374
Master!

1381
02:26:24.569 --> 02:26:26.901
That's enough.

1382
02:26:30.575 --> 02:26:32.782
Where are you leading them?

1383
02:26:34.496 --> 02:26:36.202
Faramir: Answer me.

1384
02:26:37.040 --> 02:26:40.248
Gollum: Smagol.

1385
02:26:43.713 --> 02:26:48.457
Gollum:
Why does it cry. smagol?

1386
02:26:49.719 --> 02:26:52.381
Smeagol: Cruel men hurts us.

1387
02:26:52.472 --> 02:26:55.555
Master tricksed us.

1388
02:26:55.642 --> 02:26:59.226
Gollum: Of course he did.

1389
02:26:59.604 --> 02:27:03.347
I told you he was tricksy.

1390
02:27:03.441 --> 02:27:06.558
I told you he was false.

1391
02:27:06.653 --> 02:27:09.440
Smeagol: Master is our friend.

1392
02:27:09.531 --> 02:27:11.943
Our friend.

1393
02:27:12.033 --> 02:27:14.274
Gollum: Master betrayed us.

1394
02:27:14.369 --> 02:27:17.406
Smeagol: No. Not its business.

1395
02:27:18.498 --> 02:27:20.955
I eave us alone!

1396
02:27:21.042 --> 02:27:23.533
Gollum: Filthy little hobbitses!

1397
02:27:23.628 --> 02:27:25.994
They stole it from us!

1398
02:27:26.089 --> 02:27:27.579
Smeagol: No no.

1399
02:27:28.133 --> 02:27:29.748
What did they steal?

1400
02:27:31.928 --> 02:27:37.264
Gollum: My precious!

1401
02:27:40.937 --> 02:27:42.598
We have to get out of here.

1402
02:27:43.189 --> 02:27:45.145
You go. Go. now.

1403
02:27:47.777 --> 02:27:49.608
You can do it.

1404
02:27:51.072 --> 02:27:52.562
Use the ring. Mr. Frodo.

1405
02:27:52.657 --> 02:27:54.522
Just this once.

1406
02:27:54.617 --> 02:27:56.448
Put it on.

1407
02:27:56.870 --> 02:27:58.906
Disappear.

1408
02:27:59.956 --> 02:28:01.036
I can't.

1409
02:28:04.127 --> 02:28:06.334
You were right. Sam.

1410
02:28:07.797 --> 02:28:10.288
You tried to tell me but.

1411
02:28:14.971 --> 02:28:17.132
I'm sorry.

1412
02:28:21.686 --> 02:28:24.553
The ring's taking me. Sam.

1413
02:28:25.982 --> 02:28:27.688
If I put it on...

1414
02:28:27.775 --> 02:28:30.141
He'll find me.

1415
02:28:31.821 --> 02:28:33.777
He'll see.

1416
02:28:34.991 --> 02:28:36.982
Mr Frodo

1417
02:28:41.915 --> 02:28:46.158
so this is the answer
to all the riddles.

1418
02:28:48.379 --> 02:28:51.416
Here in the wild I have you...

1419
02:28:51.507 --> 02:28:53.498
Two halflings...

1420
02:28:53.593 --> 02:28:56.801
And a host of men at my call.

1421
02:29:00.099 --> 02:29:03.591
The ring of power within my grasp.

1422
02:29:13.279 --> 02:29:17.022
A chance for faramir.
captain of gondor...

1423
02:29:18.618 --> 02:29:21.655
To show his quality.

1424
02:29:42.767 --> 02:29:44.382
No!

1425
02:29:47.563 --> 02:29:48.928
Stop it!

1426
02:29:49.023 --> 02:29:50.103
I eave him alone.

1427
02:29:51.442 --> 02:29:53.933
Don't you understand?

1428
02:29:57.282 --> 02:30:00.615
That's where we're going. into mordor.

1429
02:30:00.702 --> 02:30:02.408
To the mountain of fire!

1430
02:30:03.454 --> 02:30:06.617
Osgiliath is under attack.
They call for reinforcements.

1431
02:30:06.708 --> 02:30:09.745
Sam: Please it's such a burden.

1432
02:30:11.921 --> 02:30:14.003
Will you not help him?

1433
02:30:15.341 --> 02:30:17.252
Captain?

1434
02:30:17.927 --> 02:30:20.134
Prepare to leave.

1435
02:30:25.101 --> 02:30:27.513
The ring will go to gondor.

1436
02:31:43.304 --> 02:31:46.421
Get out of the way!
I'm going to kill him!

1437
02:31:46.516 --> 02:31:50.384
You are the luckiest. the canniest...

1438
02:31:50.478 --> 02:31:54.517
And the most reckless man
I ever knew.

1439
02:31:55.191 --> 02:31:56.681
Bless you. laddie.

1440
02:31:57.276 --> 02:31:59.016
Gimli. where is the king?

1441
02:32:12.792 --> 02:32:14.123
You look terrible.

1442
02:32:55.877 --> 02:32:57.959
A great host. you say?

1443
02:32:58.045 --> 02:32:59.581
All isengard is emptied.

1444
02:32:59.672 --> 02:33:00.752
How many?

1445
02:33:01.424 --> 02:33:04.416
Aragorn:
Ten thousand strong at least.

1446
02:33:05.970 --> 02:33:07.426
Ten thousand?

1447
02:33:07.847 --> 02:33:10.338
It is an army bred for a single purpose:

1448
02:33:13.019 --> 02:33:15.135
To destroy the world of men.

1449
02:33:17.648 --> 02:33:19.639
They will be here by nightfall.

1450
02:33:25.490 --> 02:33:26.775
I et them come!

1451
02:33:28.284 --> 02:33:31.117
I want every man and strong lad
able to bear arms

1452
02:33:31.204 --> 02:33:34.367
to be ready for battle by nightfall.

1453
02:33:42.632 --> 02:33:45.590
We will cover the causeway
and the gate from above.

1454
02:33:45.676 --> 02:33:48.167
No army has ever breached
the deeping wall...

1455
02:33:48.262 --> 02:33:51.095
Or set foot inside the hornburg!

1456
02:33:51.182 --> 02:33:53.639
This is no rabble of mindless orcs.

1457
02:33:54.227 --> 02:33:56.468
These are uruk-hai.

1458
02:33:56.562 --> 02:34:00.020
Their armour is thick
and their shields broad.

1459
02:34:01.651 --> 02:34:05.360
I have fought many wars.
master dwarf.

1460
02:34:05.446 --> 02:34:09.109
I know how to defend my own keep.

1461
02:34:15.706 --> 02:34:19.164
They will break upon this fortress
like water on rock.

1462
02:34:19.252 --> 02:34:24.588
Saruman's hordes will pillage and burn.
We've seen it before.

1463
02:34:24.674 --> 02:34:27.416
Crops can be resown...

1464
02:34:27.510 --> 02:34:30.547
Homes rebuilt.

1465
02:34:31.180 --> 02:34:33.717
Within these walls

1466
02:34:34.100 --> 02:34:35.636
we will outlast them.

1467
02:34:35.726 --> 02:34:38.217
They do not come to destroy Rohan's
crops or villages.

1468
02:34:38.312 --> 02:34:39.927
They come to destroy its people...

1469
02:34:40.022 --> 02:34:42.559
Down to the last child.

1470
02:34:43.442 --> 02:34:45.728
What would you have me do?

1471
02:34:45.820 --> 02:34:47.651
Look at my men.

1472
02:34:47.738 --> 02:34:49.524
Their courage hangs by a thread.

1473
02:34:51.701 --> 02:34:56.161
If this is to be our end. then I would
have them make such an end

1474
02:34:56.247 --> 02:34:59.330
as to be worthy of remembrance.

1475
02:35:02.962 --> 02:35:04.873
Aragorn:
Send out riders. my lord.

1476
02:35:05.172 --> 02:35:08.039
You must call for aid.

1477
02:35:11.304 --> 02:35:13.545
And who will come?

1478
02:35:13.973 --> 02:35:15.588
Flves?

1479
02:35:15.683 --> 02:35:17.799
Dwarves?

1480
02:35:18.561 --> 02:35:21.428
We are not so lucky in our friends
as you.

1481
02:35:22.273 --> 02:35:24.559
The old alliances are dead

1482
02:35:24.984 --> 02:35:27.817
gondor will answer. Gondor?!

1483
02:35:27.903 --> 02:35:30.144
Where was gondor
when the westfold fell?!

1484
02:35:31.115 --> 02:35:34.403
Where was gondor when
our enemies closed in around us?!

1485
02:35:34.493 --> 02:35:36.449
Where was gon... "?

1486
02:35:39.123 --> 02:35:41.079
No. my lord aragorn...

1487
02:35:42.668 --> 02:35:45.125
We are alone.

1488
02:35:52.011 --> 02:35:53.797
Get the women and children
into the caves

1489
02:35:53.888 --> 02:35:55.282
man 1: We need more time
to lay provisions...

1490
02:35:55.306 --> 02:35:58.844
Theoden:
There is no time. War is upon us.

1491
02:35:59.101 --> 02:36:00.807
Man 2: Secure the gate.

1492
02:36:06.025 --> 02:36:08.186
We ents have not troubled

1493
02:36:08.277 --> 02:36:11.690
about the wars of men and wizards

1494
02:36:12.448 --> 02:36:15.440
for a very long time.

1495
02:36:16.702 --> 02:36:21.492
But now. something
is about to happen...

1496
02:36:21.582 --> 02:36:24.039
That has not happened...

1497
02:36:24.126 --> 02:36:26.617
For an age.

1498
02:36:27.838 --> 02:36:30.124
Fentmoot.

1499
02:36:30.508 --> 02:36:31.543
What's that?

1500
02:36:31.967 --> 02:36:34.800
"Tis a gathering.

1501
02:36:35.971 --> 02:36:38.553
A gathering of what?

1502
02:36:56.492 --> 02:36:58.858
Treebeard: Beech oak.

1503
02:36:58.953 --> 02:37:00.909
Chestnut. Ash.

1504
02:37:01.163 --> 02:37:03.199
Good. Good. Good.

1505
02:37:03.290 --> 02:37:05.656
Many have come.

1506
02:37:13.217 --> 02:37:16.050
Now we must decide if the ents

1507
02:37:16.137 --> 02:37:18.719
will go to war.

1508
02:37:27.690 --> 02:37:30.727
Guard 1:
Move back! Move to the caves!

1509
02:37:33.195 --> 02:37:35.277
Guard 2:
Come on. people! Quickly. now!

1510
02:37:35.698 --> 02:37:38.030
We'll place the reserves along the wall.

1511
02:37:38.117 --> 02:37:40.483
They can support the archers
from above the gate.

1512
02:37:40.578 --> 02:37:43.786
Aragorn. you must rest.

1513
02:37:43.873 --> 02:37:45.454
You're no use to us half alive.

1514
02:37:46.751 --> 02:37:47.991
Eowyn: Aragorn!

1515
02:37:51.380 --> 02:37:54.463
I'm to be sent with the women
into the caves.

1516
02:37:54.550 --> 02:37:56.290
That is an honorable charge.

1517
02:37:56.385 --> 02:37:59.343
To mind the children. to find food
and bedding when the men return.

1518
02:37:59.430 --> 02:38:01.216
What renown is there in that?

1519
02:38:01.307 --> 02:38:05.050
My lady. a time may come for valor
without renown.

1520
02:38:05.311 --> 02:38:08.144
Who then will your people look to
in the last defense?

1521
02:38:08.230 --> 02:38:13.270
- Let me stand at your side.
- It is not in my power to command it.

1522
02:38:13.569 --> 02:38:16.436
You do not command
the others to stay!

1523
02:38:16.530 --> 02:38:20.318
They fight beside you because they
would not be parted from you.

1524
02:38:21.494 --> 02:38:23.701
Because they love you.

1525
02:38:30.795 --> 02:38:32.331
I'm sorry.

1526
02:39:38.237 --> 02:39:41.525
Farmers. farriers. stable boys.

1527
02:39:42.616 --> 02:39:44.402
These are no soldiers.

1528
02:39:46.662 --> 02:39:50.154
Most have seen too many winters.
Or too few.

1529
02:39:54.086 --> 02:39:57.044
Look at them. They're frightened.

1530
02:39:57.131 --> 02:39:58.621
I can see it in their eyes.

1531
02:40:13.063 --> 02:40:14.348
Aragorn.

1532
02:40:19.570 --> 02:40:21.777
Then I shall die as one of them!

1533
02:40:28.203 --> 02:40:30.034
Gimli: Let him go. lad.

1534
02:40:30.623 --> 02:40:32.534
I et him be.

1535
02:40:34.043 --> 02:40:39.538
Every villager able to wield a sword
has been sent to the armoury.

1536
02:40:43.802 --> 02:40:45.713
My lord?

1537
02:40:47.765 --> 02:40:50.347
Who am I. gamling?

1538
02:40:53.729 --> 02:40:57.597
You are our king. sire.

1539
02:41:00.611 --> 02:41:03.853
And do you trust your king?

1540
02:41:05.407 --> 02:41:08.615
Your men. my lord...

1541
02:41:08.702 --> 02:41:11.535
Will follow you to whatever end.

1542
02:41:18.420 --> 02:41:20.331
To whatever end.

1543
02:41:30.182 --> 02:41:33.800
Where is the horse and the rider?

1544
02:41:33.894 --> 02:41:36.977
Where is the horn that was blowing?

1545
02:41:38.482 --> 02:41:42.942
They have passed like rain
oh the mountains.

1546
02:41:43.946 --> 02:41:47.154
[ Tke wind in the Meadow.

1547
02:41:50.828 --> 02:41:54.571
The days have gone down in the west...

1548
02:41:55.290 --> 02:41:57.906
Behind the hills.

1549
02:41:59.837 --> 02:42:01.452
Into shadow.

1550
02:42:09.930 --> 02:42:13.343
How did it come to this?

1551
02:42:29.658 --> 02:42:31.273
Huh?

1552
02:42:34.663 --> 02:42:36.494
It's been going for hours.

1553
02:42:37.666 --> 02:42:40.123
They must have decided something
by now.

1554
02:42:40.210 --> 02:42:44.374
Treebeard: Decided? No.

1555
02:42:44.465 --> 02:42:49.676
We only just finished saying...

1556
02:42:50.846 --> 02:42:52.711
Good morning.

1557
02:42:54.058 --> 02:42:57.300
But it's nighttime already.

1558
02:42:57.394 --> 02:42:59.225
You can't take forever.

1559
02:43:00.230 --> 02:43:02.312
Don't be hasty.

1560
02:43:02.733 --> 02:43:05.145
We're running out of time!

1561
02:43:08.280 --> 02:43:11.113
Guard:
Move! Move to the outer wall.

1562
02:43:28.675 --> 02:43:29.960
Give me your sword.

1563
02:43:39.478 --> 02:43:40.638
What is your name?

1564
02:43:41.230 --> 02:43:43.562
Haleth. son of hama. my lord.

1565
02:43:45.734 --> 02:43:48.316
The men are saying that
we will not live out the night.

1566
02:43:50.322 --> 02:43:52.278
They say that it is hopeless.

1567
02:44:10.092 --> 02:44:11.707
This is a good sword.

1568
02:44:13.762 --> 02:44:16.094
Haleth. son of hama...

1569
02:44:20.435 --> 02:44:22.596
There is always hope.

1570
02:44:45.586 --> 02:44:48.999
We have trusted you this far.
You have not led us astray.

1571
02:44:49.089 --> 02:44:50.704
Forgive me.

1572
02:44:50.799 --> 02:44:52.255
I was wrong to despair.

1573
02:45:01.143 --> 02:45:04.260
We had time. I'd get this adjusted.

1574
02:45:07.733 --> 02:45:09.769
It's a little tight across the chest.

1575
02:45:15.991 --> 02:45:17.902
That is no orc horn.

1576
02:45:23.624 --> 02:45:25.489
Send for the king.

1577
02:45:25.584 --> 02:45:29.202
- Open the gate!
Guard: Open up the gate!

1578
02:46:00.869 --> 02:46:02.530
How is this possible?

1579
02:46:03.538 --> 02:46:07.247
I bring word from elrond of rivendell.

1580
02:46:07.334 --> 02:46:10.576
An alliance once existed
between elves and men.

1581
02:46:11.296 --> 02:46:15.505
Long ago we fought and died together.

1582
02:46:17.803 --> 02:46:20.670
We come to honor that allegiance.

1583
02:46:29.189 --> 02:46:31.100
You are most welcome.

1584
02:46:36.488 --> 02:46:40.276
We are proud to fight
alongside men once more.

1585
02:47:14.067 --> 02:47:17.309
Gimli:
You could have picked a better spot.

1586
02:47:22.159 --> 02:47:26.368
Well. lad. whatever luck you live by.
let's hope it lasts the night.

1587
02:47:32.502 --> 02:47:34.288
Your friends are with you. aragorn.

1588
02:47:34.921 --> 02:47:37.412
Let's hope they last the night.

1589
02:49:18.859 --> 02:49:21.692
- What's happening out there?
- Shall I describe it to you?

1590
02:49:22.946 --> 02:49:24.732
Or would you like me to find you a box?

1591
02:50:27.928 --> 02:50:29.759
So it begins.

1592
02:50:56.623 --> 02:50:57.954
Did they hit anything?

1593
02:50:58.625 --> 02:51:00.661
Give them a volley.

1594
02:51:00.752 --> 02:51:02.913
- Fire!
- Firel

1595
02:51:41.126 --> 02:51:42.161
(00d!

1596
02:51:48.967 --> 02:51:51.959
Swords! Swords!

1597
02:52:30.050 --> 02:52:32.211
Legolas! Two already!

1598
02:52:32.302 --> 02:52:34.509
I'mon 17!

1599
02:52:34.596 --> 02:52:37.212
I'll have no pointy-ear outscoring me!

1600
02:52:44.022 --> 02:52:45.728
Nineteen!

1601
02:53:11.716 --> 02:53:13.126
Merry.

1602
02:53:17.555 --> 02:53:21.343
We have just agreed.

1603
02:53:31.361 --> 02:53:32.817
Yes?

1604
02:53:34.322 --> 02:53:38.486
I have told your names to the entmoot...

1605
02:53:39.619 --> 02:53:42.861
And we have agreed...

1606
02:53:43.331 --> 02:53:47.370
You are not orcs.

1607
02:53:49.129 --> 02:53:51.290
Well. that's good news.

1608
02:53:51.381 --> 02:53:55.545
And what about saruman?
Have you come to a decision about him?

1609
02:53:56.177 --> 02:54:00.011
Now. don't be hasty. master meriadoc.

1610
02:54:00.098 --> 02:54:01.679
Hasty?

1611
02:54:02.475 --> 02:54:04.386
Our friends are out there.

1612
02:54:04.477 --> 02:54:08.686
They need our help. They cannot
fight this war on their own.

1613
02:54:09.023 --> 02:54:11.355
War? Yes.

1614
02:54:11.443 --> 02:54:13.399
It affects us all.

1615
02:54:13.486 --> 02:54:16.523
Tree. root and twig.

1616
02:54:17.407 --> 02:54:21.525
But you must understand. young hobbit...

1617
02:54:21.619 --> 02:54:23.610
It takes a long time...

1618
02:54:23.705 --> 02:54:28.699
To say anything in old entish...

1619
02:54:28.793 --> 02:54:33.082
And we never say anything...

1620
02:54:33.173 --> 02:54:37.166
Unless it is worth taking...

1621
02:54:37.260 --> 02:54:41.344
A long time to say.

1622
02:54:42.140 --> 02:54:45.473
Seventeen! Eighteen!

1623
02:54:45.560 --> 02:54:46.675
Nineteen!

1624
02:54:47.228 --> 02:54:49.139
Twenty!

1625
02:54:49.230 --> 02:54:50.936
Twenty-one!

1626
02:55:01.034 --> 02:55:02.114
Causeway!

1627
02:55:10.794 --> 02:55:13.206
Is this it?

1628
02:55:13.296 --> 02:55:16.254
Is this all you can conjure. saruman?

1629
02:56:42.260 --> 02:56:43.625
Brace the gate!

1630
02:57:01.946 --> 02:57:04.187
Hold them! Stand firm!

1631
02:57:12.081 --> 02:57:13.412
Aragorn!

1632
02:57:18.046 --> 02:57:19.252
Gimli!

1633
02:58:08.012 --> 02:58:11.925
The ents cannot hold back this storm.

1634
02:58:12.725 --> 02:58:16.718
We must weather such things
as we have always done.

1635
02:58:17.563 --> 02:58:19.645
How can that be your decision?!

1636
02:58:20.316 --> 02:58:23.934
This is not our war.

1637
02:58:24.237 --> 02:58:26.444
But you're part of this world!

1638
02:58:30.576 --> 02:58:32.407
Aren't you?!

1639
02:58:36.499 --> 02:58:38.865
You must help. Please.

1640
02:58:40.169 --> 02:58:42.911
You must do something.

1641
02:58:43.214 --> 02:58:47.503
You are young and brave. master merry.

1642
02:58:48.720 --> 02:58:52.463
But your part in this tale is over.

1643
02:58:52.557 --> 02:58:54.843
Go back to your home.

1644
02:59:04.861 --> 02:59:07.147
Maybe treebeard's right.

1645
02:59:07.238 --> 02:59:09.194
We don't belong here. merry.

1646
02:59:09.282 --> 02:59:11.648
It's too big for us.

1647
02:59:11.743 --> 02:59:14.450
What can we do in the end?

1648
02:59:16.748 --> 02:59:19.364
We've got the shire.

1649
02:59:19.917 --> 02:59:22.454
Maybe we should go home.

1650
02:59:24.297 --> 02:59:27.539
The fires of isengard will spread...

1651
02:59:27.633 --> 02:59:32.627
And the woods of tuckborough
and buckland will burn.

1652
02:59:32.722 --> 02:59:34.337
And

1653
02:59:36.142 --> 02:59:39.225
and all that was once green and good
in this world will be gone.

1654
02:59:42.774 --> 02:59:45.686
There won't be a shire. pippin.

1655
03:00:05.213 --> 03:00:06.498
Gamling: Aragorn!

1656
03:00:06.589 --> 03:00:09.046
Fall back to the keep!

1657
03:00:09.133 --> 03:00:12.250
Get your men out of there!

1658
03:00:21.896 --> 03:00:23.557
Haldir!

1659
03:00:27.693 --> 03:00:30.935
Gimli: What are you doing?
What are you stopping for?

1660
03:00:50.174 --> 03:00:51.380
Haldir!

1661
03:01:34.093 --> 03:01:35.583
Man: Brace the gate!

1662
03:01:37.805 --> 03:01:39.090
Hold them!

1663
03:01:40.933 --> 03:01:44.300
To the gate. Draw your swords!

1664
03:02:12.465 --> 03:02:14.376
Make way!

1665
03:02:17.303 --> 03:02:19.009
We cannot hold much longer!

1666
03:02:24.977 --> 03:02:28.595
Theoden: Hold them!
- How long do you need?

1667
03:02:28.689 --> 03:02:31.351
As long as you can give me.

1668
03:02:31.442 --> 03:02:33.148
Gimli!

1669
03:02:34.612 --> 03:02:36.022
Timbers!

1670
03:02:36.113 --> 03:02:38.104
Man: Brace the gate!

1671
03:02:52.880 --> 03:02:54.586
Come on. We can take them.

1672
03:02:55.424 --> 03:02:57.039
It's a long way.

1673
03:03:02.306 --> 03:03:04.046
Toss me.

1674
03:03:05.226 --> 03:03:07.091
- What?
- I cannot jump the distance!

1675
03:03:07.186 --> 03:03:08.801
You'll have to toss me!

1676
03:03:14.402 --> 03:03:15.687
Don't tell the felf

1677
03:03:16.195 --> 03:03:17.981
not a word.

1678
03:03:33.212 --> 03:03:34.702
Shore up the door!

1679
03:03:34.797 --> 03:03:36.958
Man 1: Make way!
Man 2: Follow me to the barricade.

1680
03:03:37.049 --> 03:03:38.164
Man 1: Watch our backs!

1681
03:03:42.305 --> 03:03:44.546
Man 3: Throw another one over here!
- Higher!

1682
03:04:34.482 --> 03:04:35.892
Man 4: Hold fast the gate!

1683
03:04:40.112 --> 03:04:43.070
Gimli! Aragorn!
Get out of there!

1684
03:04:47.787 --> 03:04:49.402
Aragorn!

1685
03:05:22.822 --> 03:05:25.279
Pull everybody back.

1686
03:05:25.658 --> 03:05:27.444
Pull them back.

1687
03:05:27.993 --> 03:05:32.115
Fall back!

1688
03:05:33.290 --> 03:05:34.905
Theoden:
They have broken through!

1689
03:05:35.000 --> 03:05:37.457
The castle is breached. Retreat!

1690
03:05:37.545 --> 03:05:39.877
Gamling: Fall back!
Theoden" retreat!

1691
03:05:39.964 --> 03:05:42.626
Aragorn:
Hurry! Inside. Get them inside!

1692
03:05:42.716 --> 03:05:45.002
Theoden: Into the keep!

1693
03:05:56.480 --> 03:06:01.474
I will leave you at the western borders
of the forest.

1694
03:06:01.569 --> 03:06:06.313
You can make your way north
to your homeland from there.

1695
03:06:12.037 --> 03:06:13.322
Wait! Stop!

1696
03:06:14.206 --> 03:06:15.696
Stop!

1697
03:06:18.836 --> 03:06:20.542
Turn around.

1698
03:06:21.464 --> 03:06:24.206
Turn around. Take us south.
South?

1699
03:06:24.300 --> 03:06:29.340
But that will lead you past isengard.

1700
03:06:29.680 --> 03:06:32.422
Yes. Exactly.

1701
03:06:32.516 --> 03:06:35.804
If we go south. we can slip
past saruman unnoticed.

1702
03:06:35.895 --> 03:06:38.637
The closer we are to danger.
the farther we are from harm.

1703
03:06:38.731 --> 03:06:40.767
It's the last thing he'll expect.

1704
03:06:43.402 --> 03:06:46.439
That doesn't make sense to me.

1705
03:06:46.530 --> 03:06:47.770
But then.

1706
03:06:47.865 --> 03:06:50.607
You are very small.

1707
03:06:51.076 --> 03:06:52.862
Perhaps you're right.

1708
03:06:55.498 --> 03:06:57.034
South it is. then.

1709
03:06:58.542 --> 03:07:01.875
Hold on. little shirelings.

1710
03:07:03.923 --> 03:07:06.710
I always like going south.

1711
03:07:06.800 --> 03:07:11.134
Somehow it feels like going downhill.

1712
03:07:11.764 --> 03:07:14.255
Are you mad? We'll be caught.

1713
03:07:14.350 --> 03:07:16.306
No. we won't.

1714
03:07:17.061 --> 03:07:19.302
Not this time.

1715
03:07:25.945 --> 03:07:26.980
Man: Look!

1716
03:07:28.614 --> 03:07:31.105
Osgiliath burns!

1717
03:07:31.200 --> 03:07:32.656
Mordor has come.

1718
03:07:33.786 --> 03:07:36.198
The ring will not save gondor.

1719
03:07:37.540 --> 03:07:39.747
It has only the power to destroy.

1720
03:07:40.626 --> 03:07:42.116
Please

1721
03:07:42.211 --> 03:07:43.872
let me go.

1722
03:07:44.922 --> 03:07:46.503
Hurry.

1723
03:07:49.969 --> 03:07:51.425
Frodo: Faramir!

1724
03:07:51.512 --> 03:07:53.878
You must let me go!

1725
03:07:54.473 --> 03:07:57.965
Treebeard:
And those little family of field mice...

1726
03:07:58.060 --> 03:08:00.927
That climb up sometimes.
and they tickle me awfully.

1727
03:08:01.647 --> 03:08:04.980
They're always trying to get somewhere
where they...

1728
03:08:16.161 --> 03:08:19.073
Many of these trees were my friends.

1729
03:08:19.790 --> 03:08:24.409
Creatures I had known
from nut and acorn.

1730
03:08:25.588 --> 03:08:26.828
I'm sorry. treebeard.

1731
03:08:26.922 --> 03:08:29.709
They had voices of their own.

1732
03:08:31.969 --> 03:08:34.506
Saruman.

1733
03:08:34.847 --> 03:08:37.930
A wizard should know better!

1734
03:08:52.197 --> 03:08:55.906
There is no curse in elvish

1735
03:08:55.993 --> 03:08:58.735
entish or the tongues of men...

1736
03:08:58.829 --> 03:09:01.195
For this treachery.

1737
03:09:02.625 --> 03:09:05.458
Look! The trees! They're moving!

1738
03:09:10.174 --> 03:09:11.380
Where are they going?

1739
03:09:11.884 --> 03:09:15.126
They have business with the orcs.

1740
03:09:15.596 --> 03:09:19.930
My business is with isengard tonight...

1741
03:09:20.017 --> 03:09:22.679
With rock and stone.

1742
03:09:46.585 --> 03:09:47.745
Yes

1743
03:09:48.837 --> 03:09:50.247
treebeard: Come. my friends.

1744
03:09:51.590 --> 03:09:55.833
The ents are going to war.

1745
03:09:55.928 --> 03:09:57.793
It is likely...

1746
03:09:57.888 --> 03:10:01.426
That we go to our doom.

1747
03:10:02.851 --> 03:10:05.308
I ast march...

1748
03:10:05.854 --> 03:10:07.890
Of the ents.

1749
03:10:55.988 --> 03:10:59.776
Faramir! Orcs have taken the eastern
shore. Their numbers are too great.

1750
03:10:59.867 --> 03:11:01.983
By nightfall we will be overrun.

1751
03:11:04.747 --> 03:11:06.203
Mr Frodo?

1752
03:11:06.498 --> 03:11:10.662
It's calling to him. Sam.
His eye is almost on me.

1753
03:11:10.753 --> 03:11:13.290
Hold on. Mr. Frodo.
You'll be all right.

1754
03:11:27.603 --> 03:11:29.013
Take them to my father.

1755
03:11:30.564 --> 03:11:33.556
Tell him faramir sends a mighty gift.

1756
03:11:35.986 --> 03:11:39.023
A weapon that will change our fortunes
in this war.

1757
03:11:40.199 --> 03:11:42.861
Do you want to know
what happened to Boromir?

1758
03:11:43.535 --> 03:11:46.277
You want to know
why your brother died?

1759
03:11:46.789 --> 03:11:50.577
He tried to take the ring from Frodo
after swearing an oath to protect him!

1760
03:11:50.667 --> 03:11:52.623
He tried to kill him!

1761
03:11:52.711 --> 03:11:55.077
The ring drove your brother mad!

1762
03:11:55.881 --> 03:11:57.712
Ithilien ranger: Watch out!

1763
03:12:08.644 --> 03:12:09.759
Mr Frodo?

1764
03:12:12.397 --> 03:12:14.228
They're here.

1765
03:12:17.361 --> 03:12:19.818
They've come.

1766
03:12:22.407 --> 03:12:24.363
Nazgul!

1767
03:12:46.431 --> 03:12:48.592
Stay here. Keep out of sight.

1768
03:12:50.394 --> 03:12:52.601
Take cover!

1769
03:13:09.955 --> 03:13:11.491
Theoden: The fortress is taken.

1770
03:13:12.291 --> 03:13:13.497
It is over.

1771
03:13:13.584 --> 03:13:17.623
You said this fortress would never fall
while your men defend it.

1772
03:13:17.713 --> 03:13:20.671
They still defend it.
They have died defending it.

1773
03:13:23.427 --> 03:13:24.792
Woman 1: They're breaking in!

1774
03:13:27.472 --> 03:13:29.963
Woman 2: They're past the door!

1775
03:13:33.312 --> 03:13:37.396
Is there no other way for the women
and children to get out of the caves?

1776
03:13:40.110 --> 03:13:42.021
Is there no other way?

1777
03:13:43.614 --> 03:13:46.651
There is one passage.
It leads into the mountains.

1778
03:13:47.326 --> 03:13:49.533
But they will not get far.
The uruk-hai are too many.

1779
03:13:54.416 --> 03:13:56.873
Tell the women and children
to make for the mountain pass.

1780
03:13:56.960 --> 03:13:59.827
- And barricade the entrance!
- So much death.

1781
03:14:02.007 --> 03:14:05.420
What can men do
against such reckless hate?

1782
03:14:10.098 --> 03:14:11.508
Ride out with me.

1783
03:14:15.646 --> 03:14:17.261
Ride out and meet them.

1784
03:14:18.023 --> 03:14:20.230
For death and glory.

1785
03:14:20.317 --> 03:14:21.773
For Rohan.

1786
03:14:23.278 --> 03:14:24.734
For your people.

1787
03:14:25.489 --> 03:14:27.400
The sun is rising.

1788
03:14:31.912 --> 03:14:34.949
Gandalf: Look to my coming
at first light on the fifth day.

1789
03:14:35.040 --> 03:14:36.530
At dawn

1790
03:14:36.625 --> 03:14:38.365
look to the east

1791
03:14:42.547 --> 03:14:44.208
yes

1792
03:14:46.677 --> 03:14:48.338
yes

1793
03:14:49.680 --> 03:14:52.092
the horn of helm hammerhand.

1794
03:14:52.182 --> 03:14:55.049
Shall sound in the deep...

1795
03:14:55.477 --> 03:14:57.513
One last time.

1796
03:14:57.604 --> 03:14:59.140
Yes!

1797
03:15:02.192 --> 03:15:05.980
Let this be the hour
when we draw swords together.

1798
03:15:13.745 --> 03:15:15.076
Fell deeds. awake.

1799
03:15:16.289 --> 03:15:17.449
Now for wrath

1800
03:15:17.541 --> 03:15:20.954
now for ruin and a red dawn.

1801
03:15:28.010 --> 03:15:30.251
Forth eorlingas!

1802
03:16:18.060 --> 03:16:19.300
(Sandalf.

1803
03:16:26.568 --> 03:16:30.231
Theoden king stands alone.

1804
03:16:30.822 --> 03:16:32.983
Not alone.

1805
03:16:33.408 --> 03:16:34.523
Rohirrim!

1806
03:16:40.457 --> 03:16:41.663
Eomer.

1807
03:16:41.750 --> 03:16:44.332
To the king!

1808
03:18:01.913 --> 03:18:03.699
Yes!

1809
03:18:12.841 --> 03:18:16.174
Treebeard: A hit. A fine hit.

1810
03:18:40.827 --> 03:18:43.318
Treebeard: Break the dam!

1811
03:18:43.413 --> 03:18:46.905
Release the river!

1812
03:19:14.236 --> 03:19:16.978
Pippin! Hold on!

1813
03:19:22.244 --> 03:19:25.156
Hold on. little hobbits.

1814
03:20:06.538 --> 03:20:08.529
What are you doing?

1815
03:20:17.132 --> 03:20:18.713
Where are you going?

1816
03:21:16.858 --> 03:21:18.189
It's me.

1817
03:21:20.695 --> 03:21:22.902
It's your Sam.

1818
03:21:27.243 --> 03:21:29.859
Don't you know your Sam?

1819
03:21:47.597 --> 03:21:50.964
I can't do this. Sam.

1820
03:21:51.851 --> 03:21:53.842
I know.

1821
03:21:54.854 --> 03:21:57.220
It's all wrong.

1822
03:21:57.982 --> 03:21:59.973
By rights. we shouldn't even be here.

1823
03:22:07.409 --> 03:22:09.491
But we are.

1824
03:22:15.917 --> 03:22:19.000
It's like in the great stories. Mr. Frodo.

1825
03:22:19.087 --> 03:22:21.499
The ones that really mattered.

1826
03:22:22.549 --> 03:22:25.586
Full of darkness and danger they were.

1827
03:22:25.677 --> 03:22:28.714
And sometimes you didn't want
to know the end.

1828
03:22:28.805 --> 03:22:31.797
Because how could the end be happy?

1829
03:22:34.352 --> 03:22:36.593
How could the world go back
to the way it was...

1830
03:22:36.688 --> 03:22:40.226
When so much bad had happened?

1831
03:22:41.067 --> 03:22:43.023
Victory!

1832
03:22:43.111 --> 03:22:44.726
We have victory!

1833
03:22:44.821 --> 03:22:48.860
Sam: But in the end.
it's only a passing thing...

1834
03:22:48.950 --> 03:22:50.360
This shadow.

1835
03:22:50.452 --> 03:22:52.909
Even darkness must pass.

1836
03:22:52.996 --> 03:22:55.783
A new day will come.

1837
03:22:55.874 --> 03:22:59.867
And when the sun shines.
it will shine out the clearer

1838
03:23:01.796 --> 03:23:04.208
those were the stories
that stayed with you...

1839
03:23:04.299 --> 03:23:06.130
That meant something.

1840
03:23:06.217 --> 03:23:08.833
Even if you were too small
to understand why.

1841
03:23:10.221 --> 03:23:14.089
But I think. Mr. Frodo. I do understand.

1842
03:23:14.184 --> 03:23:15.799
I know now.

1843
03:23:16.644 --> 03:23:18.885
Folk in those stories.

1844
03:23:18.980 --> 03:23:23.189
Had lots of chances of turning back.
only they didn't.

1845
03:23:23.276 --> 03:23:25.562
They kept going...

1846
03:23:26.237 --> 03:23:29.479
Because they were holding
on to something.

1847
03:23:31.075 --> 03:23:33.407
What are we holding on to. Sam?

1848
03:23:45.340 --> 03:23:49.253
That there's some good
in this world. Mr. Frodo.

1849
03:23:49.552 --> 03:23:52.168
And it's worth fighting for.

1850
03:24:19.082 --> 03:24:23.371
I think at last we understand one another.
Frodo Baggins.

1851
03:24:24.128 --> 03:24:28.121
You know the laws of our country.
the laws of your father.

1852
03:24:28.216 --> 03:24:30.457
If you let them go.
your life will be forfeit.

1853
03:24:34.806 --> 03:24:36.216
Then it is forfeit.

1854
03:24:38.977 --> 03:24:40.763
Release them.

1855
03:24:52.824 --> 03:24:54.906
Eomer: Stay out of the forest!

1856
03:24:54.993 --> 03:24:56.824
Keep away from the trees!

1857
03:25:47.670 --> 03:25:49.501
Final count.

1858
03:25:49.589 --> 03:25:52.581
- 42.
- Forty-two?

1859
03:25:52.675 --> 03:25:58.762
Oh. that's not bad for a pointy-eared
elvish princeling.

1860
03:25:59.557 --> 03:26:03.220
I myself am sitting pretty on 43.

1861
03:26:07.357 --> 03:26:10.645
- Forty-three.
- He was already dead.

1862
03:26:11.402 --> 03:26:13.939
- He was twitching.
- He was twitching...

1863
03:26:14.030 --> 03:26:18.694
Because he's got my ax
embedded in his nervous system!

1864
03:26:20.995 --> 03:26:25.705
Merry: He doesn't look happy. does he?
Pippin: Not too happy at all. merry.

1865
03:26:25.958 --> 03:26:29.542
Still. I suppose the view
would be quite nice from up there.

1866
03:26:29.629 --> 03:26:32.666
Oh. yes. It's a quality establishment.

1867
03:26:32.757 --> 03:26:35.624
I hear the staff are very good.

1868
03:26:41.307 --> 03:26:43.719
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

1869
03:26:43.810 --> 03:26:48.144
- The world's back to normal. that's all.
- No. it isn't.

1870
03:26:48.231 --> 03:26:49.562
I'm starving.

1871
03:26:49.649 --> 03:26:52.812
Good luck trying to find something
decent around here.

1872
03:26:52.902 --> 03:26:56.019
Probably dead rats and moldy bread.

1873
03:27:19.971 --> 03:27:22.383
Saruman's storeroom!

1874
03:27:24.726 --> 03:27:27.513
I don't believe it.

1875
03:27:27.603 --> 03:27:29.685
It can't be.

1876
03:27:30.314 --> 03:27:33.181
- It is!
- Longbottom leaf.

1877
03:27:34.485 --> 03:27:36.817
The finest pipe-weed in south farthing.

1878
03:27:37.155 --> 03:27:40.318
It's perfect. One barrel each.

1879
03:27:40.408 --> 03:27:41.568
Wait

1880
03:27:42.326 --> 03:27:43.637
do you think we should share it
with treebeard?

1881
03:27:43.661 --> 03:27:45.242
Share it?

1882
03:27:47.081 --> 03:27:49.493
No no.

1883
03:27:51.002 --> 03:27:52.333
Dead plant and all that.

1884
03:27:52.754 --> 03:27:54.915
Don't think he'd understand.

1885
03:27:56.174 --> 03:27:58.381
Could be a distant relative.

1886
03:27:59.177 --> 03:28:01.714
I get it.

1887
03:28:01.804 --> 03:28:04.671
Don't be hasty.

1888
03:28:05.767 --> 03:28:07.507
Exactly.

1889
03:28:08.603 --> 03:28:10.844
Bar-hrum.

1890
03:28:36.506 --> 03:28:37.837
This is the old sewer.

1891
03:28:37.924 --> 03:28:41.132
Runs right under the river
through to the edge of the city.

1892
03:28:41.219 --> 03:28:43.005
You'll find cover in the woods there:

1893
03:28:44.055 --> 03:28:46.546
Captain faramir...

1894
03:28:47.183 --> 03:28:49.014
You have shown your quality. sir.

1895
03:28:51.521 --> 03:28:52.806
The very highest.

1896
03:28:53.314 --> 03:28:55.976
The shire must truly be a great realm.
master gamgee...

1897
03:28:56.067 --> 03:28:59.059
Where gardeners are held in high honor.

1898
03:29:00.238 --> 03:29:02.229
What road will you take
once you reach the woods?

1899
03:29:02.824 --> 03:29:04.439
Gollum says there's a path...

1900
03:29:04.534 --> 03:29:08.493
Near minas morgul
that climbs up into the mountains.

1901
03:29:08.955 --> 03:29:10.695
Cirith ungol?

1902
03:29:14.252 --> 03:29:16.834
- Is that its name?
- No.

1903
03:29:16.921 --> 03:29:18.627
No!

1904
03:29:19.465 --> 03:29:22.457
- Yes.
- Frodo...

1905
03:29:22.844 --> 03:29:26.382
They say a dark terror dwells
in the passes above minas morgul.

1906
03:29:27.265 --> 03:29:29.802
- You cannot go that way.
Smeagol.: It is the only way.

1907
03:29:30.142 --> 03:29:36.433
Master says we must go to mordor.
so we must try.

1908
03:29:37.942 --> 03:29:39.728
I must.

1909
03:29:43.281 --> 03:29:46.899
Go. Frodo.
Go with the goodwill of all men.

1910
03:29:46.993 --> 03:29:49.075
Thank you.

1911
03:30:00.882 --> 03:30:05.000
May death find you quickly
if you bring them to harm.

1912
03:30:17.481 --> 03:30:19.017
Sam: Come on. keep up.

1913
03:30:22.486 --> 03:30:25.273
Mr. Frodo didn't mean for them rangers
to hurt you.

1914
03:30:25.907 --> 03:30:27.738
You know that. don't you?

1915
03:30:28.534 --> 03:30:30.115
He was trying to save you. see?

1916
03:30:30.620 --> 03:30:32.156
Save me?

1917
03:30:32.496 --> 03:30:34.703
So there's no hard feelings.

1918
03:30:34.790 --> 03:30:40.001
- Forgive and forget.
- No. no. no hard feelings.

1919
03:30:40.087 --> 03:30:42.749
Gollum. gollum.

1920
03:30:43.799 --> 03:30:45.539
Nice master.

1921
03:30:46.636 --> 03:30:49.503
- Nice hobbits.
Sam: Very decent of you.

1922
03:30:49.597 --> 03:30:51.929
Very decent. indeed. gollum.

1923
03:30:57.438 --> 03:31:02.649
Sauron's wrath will be terrible.
his retribution swift

1924
03:31:09.784 --> 03:31:12.776
Gandalf:
The battle for helm's deep is over.

1925
03:31:13.454 --> 03:31:16.992
The battle for middle-earth
is about to begin.

1926
03:31:22.129 --> 03:31:25.542
All our hopes now lie
with two little hobbits

1927
03:31:26.550 --> 03:31:29.758
somewhere in the wilderness.

1928
03:31:33.057 --> 03:31:36.515
I wonder if we'll ever be
put into songs or tales.

1929
03:31:36.602 --> 03:31:38.058
What?

1930
03:31:38.145 --> 03:31:42.184
I wonder if people will ever say.
"let's hear about Frodo and the ring."

1931
03:31:42.274 --> 03:31:45.607
And they'll say.
"yes! That's one of my favorite stories."

1932
03:31:45.695 --> 03:31:48.732
"Frodo was really courageous.
wasn't he. dad?"

1933
03:31:48.823 --> 03:31:50.563
"Yes. my boy.

1934
03:31:50.658 --> 03:31:54.526
The most famousest of hobbits.
And that's saying a lot."

1935
03:31:54.620 --> 03:31:57.236
Well. you've left out
one of the chief characters:

1936
03:31:57.331 --> 03:31:59.287
"Samwise the brave."

1937
03:31:59.375 --> 03:32:02.162
I want to hear more about Sam.

1938
03:32:06.465 --> 03:32:09.457
Frodo wouldn't have got far
without Sam.

1939
03:32:10.803 --> 03:32:14.842
Now. Mr. Frodo. you shouldn't make fun.
I was being serious.

1940
03:32:15.933 --> 03:32:17.298
So was I.

1941
03:32:26.193 --> 03:32:28.900
"Samwise the brave."

1942
03:32:33.159 --> 03:32:34.524
Frodo: Smagol?

1943
03:32:34.618 --> 03:32:37.610
Sam: We're not going to wait for you.
Come on.

1944
03:32:37.705 --> 03:32:39.696
Master.

1945
03:32:39.790 --> 03:32:42.782
Master looks after us.

1946
03:32:43.586 --> 03:32:46.419
Master wouldn't hurt us.

1947
03:32:46.505 --> 03:32:49.042
Gollum:
Master broke his promise.

1948
03:32:49.133 --> 03:32:51.374
Smeagol.: Don't ask smagol.

1949
03:32:51.469 --> 03:32:54.757
Poor. poor smeagol.

1950
03:32:54.847 --> 03:32:57.759
Master betrayed us.

1951
03:32:57.850 --> 03:33:01.013
Wicked. Tricksy. False.

1952
03:33:01.103 --> 03:33:05.096
We ought to wring
his filthy little neck.

1953
03:33:05.191 --> 03:33:08.024
Kill him! Kill him!

1954
03:33:08.110 --> 03:33:09.691
Kill them both!

1955
03:33:09.779 --> 03:33:13.488
And then we take the precious...

1956
03:33:13.574 --> 03:33:17.158
And we be the master!

1957
03:33:17.828 --> 03:33:20.535
But the fat hobbit. he knows.

1958
03:33:20.623 --> 03:33:23.239
Eyes always watching.

1959
03:33:23.501 --> 03:33:27.085
Then we stabs them out.

1960
03:33:27.171 --> 03:33:31.756
Put out his eyeses
and make him crawl

1961
03:33:31.842 --> 03:33:35.380
yes yes yes

1962
03:33:35.471 --> 03:33:38.258
kill them both.

1963
03:33:38.349 --> 03:33:40.931
Yes no! No!

1964
03:33:41.018 --> 03:33:44.761
It's too risky. It's too risky.

1965
03:33:45.481 --> 03:33:48.097
Sam:
Where is he? Where has he gone?

1966
03:33:48.192 --> 03:33:50.899
- Hey. gollum! Where are you?
Frodo: Smagol?

1967
03:33:50.986 --> 03:33:56.401
We could let her do it.

1968
03:33:57.368 --> 03:34:01.577
Yes she could do it.

1969
03:34:01.664 --> 03:34:06.283
Yes. precious. she could.

1970
03:34:06.377 --> 03:34:12.464
And then we takes it
once they're dead.

1971
03:34:13.384 --> 03:34:15.170
Once they're dead.

1972
03:34:15.261 --> 03:34:17.297
Shh.

1973
03:34:20.641 --> 03:34:24.384
Come on. hobbits. Long ways to go yet.

1974
03:34:24.478 --> 03:34:26.594
Smeagol will show you the way.

1975
03:34:26.689 --> 03:34:28.975
Follow me.
