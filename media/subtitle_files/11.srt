1
00:00:34.493 --> 00:00:37.656
Female voice:
The world is changed.

2
00:00:37.746 --> 00:00:40.783
I feel it in the water

3
00:00:41.542 --> 00:00:44.454
I feel it in the earth.

4
00:00:46.046 --> 00:00:49.038
I smell it in the air.

5
00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:51.422
Much that once was.

6
00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.125
Is lost.

7
00:00:53.804 --> 00:00:56.841
For none now live who remember it

8
00:01:09.778 --> 00:01:14.147
It began with the forging
of the great rings.

9
00:01:14.408 --> 00:01:16.364
Three were given to the elves:

10
00:01:16.451 --> 00:01:20.285
Immortal. wisest and fairest
of all beings.

11
00:01:21.331 --> 00:01:23.413
Seven fo the dwarf-lords:

12
00:01:24.167 --> 00:01:28.581
Great miners and craftsmen
of the mountain halls.

13
00:01:29.047 --> 00:01:30.378
And nine.

14
00:01:30.465 --> 00:01:33.582
Hine rings were gifted
to the race of men

15
00:01:33.677 --> 00:01:37.545
who. above all else. desire power.

16
00:01:39.224 --> 00:01:43.888
For within these rings was bound
the strength and will to govern each race.

17
00:01:45.397 --> 00:01:48.560
But they were all of them deceived.

18
00:01:48.817 --> 00:01:50.899
For another ring was made.

19
00:01:52.279 --> 00:01:55.316
In the land of mordor.
in the fires of mount doom.

20
00:01:55.741 --> 00:02:00.280
The dark lord Sauron forged
in secret a master ring...

21
00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:02.531
To control all others.

22
00:02:02.623 --> 00:02:06.707
And into this ring he poured
his cruelty. his malice...

23
00:02:06.793 --> 00:02:11.036
And his will to dominate all life.

24
00:02:12.007 --> 00:02:15.875
One ring to rule them all.

25
00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.460
One by one...

26
00:02:18.555 --> 00:02:23.345
The free lands of middle-earth
fell to the power of the ring.

27
00:02:23.435 --> 00:02:26.518
But there were some who resisted.

28
00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.724
A last alliance of men and elves
marched against the armies of mordor.

29
00:02:31.818 --> 00:02:36.482
And on the slopes of mount doom. they
fought for the freedom of middle-earth.

30
00:03:06.812 --> 00:03:09.428
Victory was near.

31
00:03:14.194 --> 00:03:15.934
But the power of the ring...

32
00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.190
Could not be undone.

33
00:03:42.806 --> 00:03:44.797
It was in this moment.

34
00:03:44.891 --> 00:03:47.382
When all hope had faded...

35
00:03:47.477 --> 00:03:51.641
That isildur. son of the king.
took up his father's sword.

36
00:04:22.721 --> 00:04:29.217
Sauron. the enemy of the free peoples
of middle-earth. was defeated.

37
00:04:36.109 --> 00:04:38.350
The ring passed to isildur...

38
00:04:38.445 --> 00:04:42.688
Who had this one chance
to destroy evil forever.

39
00:04:43.408 --> 00:04:45.615
But the hearts of men.

40
00:04:45.702 --> 00:04:48.239
Are easily corrupted.

41
00:04:48.497 --> 00:04:53.116
And the ring of power
has a will of its own.

42
00:05:18.318 --> 00:05:20.934
It betrayed isildur...

43
00:05:22.781 --> 00:05:25.193
To his death.

44
00:05:29.371 --> 00:05:33.330
And some things
that should not have been forgotten...

45
00:05:33.416 --> 00:05:35.782
Were lost.

46
00:05:36.628 --> 00:05:38.914
History became legend...

47
00:05:39.005 --> 00:05:41.121
Legend became myth.

48
00:05:41.216 --> 00:05:44.174
And for
two and a half thousand years...

49
00:05:44.261 --> 00:05:48.004
The ring passed
out of all knowledge.

50
00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.473
Until. when chance came...

51
00:05:52.143 --> 00:05:55.260
It ensnared a new bearer

52
00:05:56.606 --> 00:06:01.441
gollum: My precious.

53
00:06:01.695 --> 00:06:04.277
Female voice: The ring came
fo the creature gollum.

54
00:06:04.364 --> 00:06:08.323
Who took it deep into the tunnels
of the misty mountains.

55
00:06:08.618 --> 00:06:11.485
And there it consumed him.

56
00:06:11.746 --> 00:06:13.862
Gollum: It came to me.

57
00:06:13.957 --> 00:06:18.496
My own. My love. My own.

58
00:06:18.587 --> 00:06:23.331
My precious.

59
00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:30.462
Female voice: The ring brought
to gollum unnatural long life.

60
00:06:30.557 --> 00:06:34.516
For 500 years it poisoned his mind.

61
00:06:34.603 --> 00:06:39.313
And in the gloom of gollum"s cave.
it waited.

62
00:06:39.399 --> 00:06:42.687
Darkness crept back
into the forests of the world.

63
00:06:42.944 --> 00:06:45.856
Rumor grew of a shadow in the east...

64
00:06:45.947 --> 00:06:48.859
Whispers of a nameless fear.

65
00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:52.363
And the ring of power perceived...

66
00:06:52.454 --> 00:06:55.287
Its time had now come.

67
00:06:57.709 --> 00:07:00.371
It abandoned gollum.

68
00:07:01.046 --> 00:07:05.540
But something happened then
the ring did not intend.

69
00:07:06.384 --> 00:07:11.048
It was picked up by the most unlikely
creature imaginable.

70
00:07:11.139 --> 00:07:12.299
Bilbo: What's this?

71
00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:13.926
Female voice: A hobbit.

72
00:07:14.017 --> 00:07:16.884
Bilbo Baggins of the shire.

73
00:07:16.978 --> 00:07:18.843
A ring.

74
00:07:18.939 --> 00:07:20.850
Gollum: I ost!

75
00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:27.148
My precious is lost!

76
00:07:27.238 --> 00:07:29.570
Female voice:
For the time will soon come.

77
00:07:29.824 --> 00:07:34.989
When hobbits will shape
the fortunes of all.

78
00:07:39.751 --> 00:07:42.868
Bilbo:
The 22nd day of September...

79
00:07:42.963 --> 00:07:44.203
In the year 1400...

80
00:07:46.424 --> 00:07:48.039
By shire-reckoning.

81
00:07:49.427 --> 00:07:54.137
Bag end. bagshot row. hobbiton.
westfarthing...

82
00:07:55.517 --> 00:07:56.927
The shire.

83
00:07:57.018 --> 00:07:59.885
Middle-earth.

84
00:08:04.526 --> 00:08:07.859
The third age of this world.

85
00:08:19.416 --> 00:08:23.409
There and back again:

86
00:08:23.962 --> 00:08:25.827
A hobbit's tale.

87
00:08:25.922 --> 00:08:28.459
By bilbo Baggins.

88
00:08:34.723 --> 00:08:36.463
Now

89
00:08:37.183 --> 00:08:39.174
where to begin?

90
00:08:40.478 --> 00:08:41.513
Ah. yes...

91
00:08:45.984 --> 00:08:47.690
"Concerning...

92
00:08:49.362 --> 00:08:50.522
Hobbits."

93
00:08:51.656 --> 00:08:55.240
Hobbits have been living and farming
in the four farthings of the shire...

94
00:08:55.326 --> 00:08:57.408
For many hundreds of years...

95
00:08:57.495 --> 00:09:00.578
Quite content to ignore
and be ignored...

96
00:09:00.665 --> 00:09:03.873
By the world of the big folk.

97
00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:09.921
Middle-earth being. after all.
full of strange creatures beyond count...

98
00:09:10.008 --> 00:09:13.250
Hobbits must seem
of little importance...

99
00:09:13.344 --> 00:09:17.462
Being neither renowned
as great warriors...

100
00:09:17.557 --> 00:09:21.800
Hor counted among the very wise.

101
00:09:26.191 --> 00:09:29.183
Frodo! Someone at the door.

102
00:09:30.403 --> 00:09:32.940
In fact. it has been remarked by some...

103
00:09:33.198 --> 00:09:37.658
That hobbits' only real passion
is for food.

104
00:09:37.994 --> 00:09:40.235
A rather unfair observation.

105
00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:44.073
As we have also developed a keen
interest in the brewing of ales...

106
00:09:44.501 --> 00:09:47.208
And the smoking of pipe-weed.

107
00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:50.537
But where our hearts truly lie...

108
00:09:50.632 --> 00:09:52.839
Is in peace and quiet...

109
00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:55.717
And good. tilled earth.

110
00:09:55.804 --> 00:10:01.049
For all hobbits share a love
of things that grow.

111
00:10:04.187 --> 00:10:08.681
And. yes. no doubt to others.
our ways seem quaint.

112
00:10:08.775 --> 00:10:14.020
But today of all days.
it is brought home to me:

113
00:10:14.614 --> 00:10:20.484
It is no bad thing
to celebrate a simple life.

114
00:10:24.707 --> 00:10:27.870
Frodo. the door!

115
00:10:31.714 --> 00:10:32.994
Sticklebacks. Where is that boy?

116
00:10:33.883 --> 00:10:35.544
Frodo!

117
00:10:41.391 --> 00:10:44.883
Male voice:
Down from the door where it began

118
00:10:49.607 --> 00:10:53.395
and I must follow if I can

119
00:10:54.404 --> 00:10:58.488
the road goes ever on and on

120
00:10:58.741 --> 00:11:02.279
down from the door where it began

121
00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:07.364
now far ahead the road has gone

122
00:11:08.001 --> 00:11:11.789
and I must follow if I can
you're late.

123
00:11:15.091 --> 00:11:18.879
A wizard is never late. Frodo Baggins.

124
00:11:19.637 --> 00:11:24.301
Nor is he early. He arrives
precisely when he means to.

125
00:11:35.653 --> 00:11:38.770
It's wonderful to see you. Gandalf!

126
00:11:42.619 --> 00:11:46.328
You didn't think I'd miss
your uncle bilbo's birthday?

127
00:11:47.999 --> 00:11:50.160
How is the old rascal?

128
00:11:50.668 --> 00:11:54.286
I hear it's going to be a party
of special magnificence.

129
00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:56.871
You know bilbo.
He's got the whole place in an uproar.

130
00:11:56.966 --> 00:11:59.048
Well. that should please him.

131
00:11:59.135 --> 00:12:01.000
Half the shire's been invited.

132
00:12:01.304 --> 00:12:03.920
And the rest of them are turning up
anyway.

133
00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:10.427
Bilbo:
And so life in the shire goes on...

134
00:12:10.521 --> 00:12:13.684
Very much as it has
this past age...

135
00:12:13.775 --> 00:12:19.395
Jtull of its own comings and goings.
with change coming slowly.

136
00:12:19.489 --> 00:12:21.445
If it comes at all

137
00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:26.192
for things are made to endure
in the shire

138
00:12:26.287 --> 00:12:29.825
passing from one generation
fo the next.

139
00:12:30.208 --> 00:12:35.248
There's always been a Baggins
living here under the hill...

140
00:12:35.338 --> 00:12:36.703
In bag end.

141
00:12:39.509 --> 00:12:42.342
And there always will be.

142
00:12:43.012 --> 00:12:46.379
To tell you the truth.
bilbo's been a bit odd lately.

143
00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:50.011
I mean. more than usual.

144
00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:52.976
He's taken to locking himself
in his study.

145
00:12:54.524 --> 00:12:58.688
He spends hours poring over old maps
when he thinks I'm not looking.

146
00:13:11.374 --> 00:13:13.035
Where's it gone?

147
00:13:39.569 --> 00:13:41.901
He's up to something.

148
00:13:50.038 --> 00:13:52.620
All right. then. Keep your secrets.
What?

149
00:13:52.707 --> 00:13:54.493
But I know you have something
to do with it

150
00:13:54.584 --> 00:13:55.824
(good gracious me.

151
00:13:55.918 --> 00:13:58.358
Before you came along. we bagginses
were very well thought of.

152
00:13:59.088 --> 00:14:00.088
Indeed.

153
00:14:00.423 --> 00:14:02.584
Never had any adventures
or did anything unexpected.

154
00:14:03.176 --> 00:14:09.137
If you're referring to the incident
with the dragon. I was barely involved.

155
00:14:09.223 --> 00:14:12.932
All I did was give your uncle
a little nudge out of the door.

156
00:14:13.019 --> 00:14:17.103
Whatever you did. you've been officially
labeled a disturber of the peace.

157
00:14:17.565 --> 00:14:19.430
Oh. really?

158
00:14:25.073 --> 00:14:27.029
(Gandalf! Gandalf!

159
00:14:33.122 --> 00:14:34.522
Female hobbit 1:
Fireworks. Gandalf!

160
00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:40.042
Female hobbit 2: Gandalf!
Male hobbit: Fireworks. Gandalf!

161
00:14:58.898 --> 00:14:59.933
(Gandalf?

162
00:15:00.483 --> 00:15:04.601
- I'm glad you're back.
- So am I. dear boy.

163
00:15:09.075 --> 00:15:10.815
Soaml

164
00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:31.461
Whoa. whoa.

165
00:15:42.692 --> 00:15:44.228
Bilbo: No. thank you!

166
00:15:44.318 --> 00:15:48.402
We don't want any more visitors.
well-wishers or distant relations!

167
00:15:48.489 --> 00:15:52.027
And what about very old friends?

168
00:15:55.204 --> 00:15:56.865
(Gandalf?

169
00:15:57.540 --> 00:16:01.078
- Bilbo Baggins.
- My dear Gandalf!

170
00:16:01.169 --> 00:16:06.380
Good to see you. 111 years old!
Who would believe it?

171
00:16:08.134 --> 00:16:10.125
You haven't aged a day.

172
00:16:16.726 --> 00:16:18.762
Come on. come in!

173
00:16:18.853 --> 00:16:21.344
Welcome. welcome.

174
00:16:22.523 --> 00:16:25.060
Oh. here we are.

175
00:16:26.736 --> 00:16:29.227
Tea? Or maybe something
a little stronger?

176
00:16:29.322 --> 00:16:33.235
I've got a few bottles
of the old winyard left. 1296.

177
00:16:33.326 --> 00:16:37.410
Very good year. Almost as old as I am.

178
00:16:38.581 --> 00:16:43.120
It was laid down by my father.
What say we open one. eh?

179
00:16:43.211 --> 00:16:45.918
Just tea. thank you.

180
00:16:50.259 --> 00:16:52.124
Oh!

181
00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:53.926
I was expecting you sometime
last week:

182
00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:57.422
Not that it matters. You come and go as
you please. Always have and always will.

183
00:16:57.683 --> 00:17:02.973
You caught me a bit unprepared. We've only
got cold chicken and a bit of pickle...

184
00:17:03.064 --> 00:17:06.431
There's some cheese here.
No. that won't do.

185
00:17:06.692 --> 00:17:10.605
We've got raspberry jam.
an apple tart...

186
00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:15.319
But not much for afters.
Oh. no. we're all right.

187
00:17:15.409 --> 00:17:18.276
I've just found some sponge cake.

188
00:17:21.207 --> 00:17:22.687
I could make you some eggs
if you'd...

189
00:17:26.295 --> 00:17:28.957
- Just tea. thank you.
- Oh. right.

190
00:17:30.132 --> 00:17:32.498
- You don't mind if I eat. do you?
- No. not at all.

191
00:17:34.136 --> 00:17:35.536
Female hobbit:
Bilbo! Bilbo Baggins!

192
00:17:35.596 --> 00:17:37.211
I'm not at home!

193
00:17:43.229 --> 00:17:45.845
It's the sackville-bagginses.

194
00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:48.101
- I know you're in there!
- They're after the house.

195
00:17:48.776 --> 00:17:51.358
They've never forgiven me
for living this long.

196
00:17:51.445 --> 00:17:54.383
I've got to get away from these confounded
relatives. hanging on the bell all day...

197
00:17:54.407 --> 00:17:56.318
Never giving me a moment's peace.

198
00:17:57.118 --> 00:18:00.702
I want to see mountains again.
Mountains. Gandalf!

199
00:18:00.788 --> 00:18:05.373
And then find somewhere quiet
where I can finish my book. Oh. tea.

200
00:18:05.459 --> 00:18:09.543
- So you mean to go through with your plan?
- Yes. yes. It's all in hand.

201
00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:11.962
All the arrangements are made.

202
00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:15.500
Oh. thank you.

203
00:18:16.262 --> 00:18:18.378
Frodo suspects something.

204
00:18:18.472 --> 00:18:21.009
Of course he does. He's a Baggins...

205
00:18:21.267 --> 00:18:23.849
Not some blockheaded bracegirdle
from hardbottle

206
00:18:24.353 --> 00:18:27.186
you will tell him. won't you?

207
00:18:28.024 --> 00:18:30.140
- Yes. yes.
- He's very fond of you.

208
00:18:32.361 --> 00:18:33.851
I know.

209
00:18:36.198 --> 00:18:39.531
He'd probably come with me
if I asked him.

210
00:18:40.202 --> 00:18:43.660
I think in his heart. Frodo's
still in love with the shire.

211
00:18:45.207 --> 00:18:47.573
The woods. the fields.

212
00:18:47.668 --> 00:18:50.034
I ittle rivers.

213
00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:57.212
I am old. Gandalf.

214
00:18:58.554 --> 00:19:03.890
I know I don't look it. but I'm
beginning to feel it in my heart.

215
00:19:06.062 --> 00:19:08.599
I feel thin.

216
00:19:08.689 --> 00:19:10.395
Sort of stretched.

217
00:19:11.734 --> 00:19:15.101
Like butter scraped
over too much bread.

218
00:19:15.196 --> 00:19:19.781
I need a holiday. A very long holiday.

219
00:19:19.867 --> 00:19:23.200
And I don't expect I shall return.

220
00:19:25.414 --> 00:19:28.577
In fact. I mean not to.

221
00:19:31.253 --> 00:19:35.371
Old Toby. The finest weed
in the southfarthing.

222
00:19:50.106 --> 00:19:51.721
Ah

223
00:19:52.733 --> 00:19:55.315
Gandalf. my old friend...

224
00:19:55.403 --> 00:19:58.270
This will be a night to remember.

225
00:20:21.137 --> 00:20:22.137
Bilbo: Hello. hello.

226
00:20:22.471 --> 00:20:26.464
Fatty bolger. Lovely to see you.
Welcome. welcome.

227
00:20:27.476 --> 00:20:30.092
Go on. Sam. Ask Rosie for a dance.

228
00:20:32.648 --> 00:20:36.266
- I think I'll just have another ale.
- Oh. no. you don't.

229
00:20:37.319 --> 00:20:39.105
(So on!

230
00:20:49.165 --> 00:20:50.996
So there I was.

231
00:20:51.292 --> 00:20:55.376
At the mercy
of three monstrous trolls.

232
00:20:55.463 --> 00:20:57.545
And they were all arguing
amongst themselves...

233
00:20:57.631 --> 00:21:00.213
About how they were
going to cook us.

234
00:21:00.301 --> 00:21:05.341
Whether it be turned on a spit. or to sit
on us one by one. squash us into jelly.

235
00:21:06.348 --> 00:21:10.011
They spent so much time arguing
the whithertos and the whyfors...

236
00:21:10.102 --> 00:21:13.686
That the sun's first light
crept over the top of the trees...

237
00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:17.181
And turned them all to stone!

238
00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:23.855
Merry: Quickly.

239
00:21:26.327 --> 00:21:27.908
\whoal

240
00:21:27.995 --> 00:21:30.031
up they go!

241
00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.206
No. the big one.

242
00:21:43.385 --> 00:21:46.252
Mrs. bracegirdle. how nice to see you.
Welcome. welcome.

243
00:21:46.347 --> 00:21:48.383
Are all these children yours?

244
00:21:48.474 --> 00:21:51.511
Good gracious.
you have been productive.

245
00:21:53.521 --> 00:21:54.852
Female hobbit: Bilbo?

246
00:21:56.565 --> 00:21:58.226
Sackville-bagginses!

247
00:21:58.484 --> 00:21:59.564
Quickly. hide!

248
00:22:09.411 --> 00:22:11.572
Thank you. my boy.

249
00:22:13.082 --> 00:22:15.494
You're a good lad. Frodo.

250
00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:19.577
I'm very selfish. you know.

251
00:22:20.005 --> 00:22:23.463
Yes. I am. Very selfish.

252
00:22:23.551 --> 00:22:25.946
I don't know why I took you in
after your mother and father died...

253
00:22:25.970 --> 00:22:27.551
But it wasn't out of charity.

254
00:22:28.264 --> 00:22:29.754
I think it was because

255
00:22:29.849 --> 00:22:32.215
of all my numerous relations...

256
00:22:32.518 --> 00:22:36.010
You were the one Baggins
that showed real spirit.

257
00:22:36.272 --> 00:22:38.137
Bilbo. have you been
at the gaffer's home brew?

258
00:22:38.232 --> 00:22:40.018
No

259
00:22:40.276 --> 00:22:42.983
Well. yes. but that's not the point.

260
00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:46.403
The point is. Frodo...

261
00:22:49.451 --> 00:22:51.442
You'll be all right.

262
00:22:54.790 --> 00:22:56.997
- Done!
- You're supposed to stick it in the ground.

263
00:22:57.084 --> 00:22:58.665
It is in the ground. Outside!

264
00:22:58.752 --> 00:23:00.288
This was your idea.

265
00:23:16.145 --> 00:23:17.635
Bilbo.

266
00:23:18.814 --> 00:23:21.681
Bilbo. watch out for the dragon!

267
00:23:21.775 --> 00:23:25.142
Nonsense. There hasn't been a dragon
in these parts for a thousand years.

268
00:23:38.667 --> 00:23:42.330
- That was good.
- Let's get another one.

269
00:23:43.547 --> 00:23:48.132
Gandalf:
Meriadoc brandybuck and peregrin took.

270
00:23:48.218 --> 00:23:50.129
I might've known.

271
00:23:56.018 --> 00:23:58.100
Female hobbit: Speech. bilbo!

272
00:23:58.979 --> 00:24:00.389
Male hobbit: Speech!

273
00:24:00.481 --> 00:24:01.596
Speech!

274
00:24:06.862 --> 00:24:09.148
My dear bagginses and boffins...

275
00:24:09.949 --> 00:24:12.190
100ks and brandybucks...

276
00:24:12.284 --> 00:24:14.900
Grubbs. chubbs...

277
00:24:14.995 --> 00:24:16.075
Hornblowers

278
00:24:17.206 --> 00:24:18.867
bolgers...

279
00:24:19.291 --> 00:24:20.906
Bracegirdles...

280
00:24:21.001 --> 00:24:23.663
- And proudfoots.
- Proudfeet!

281
00:24:25.839 --> 00:24:29.002
Today is my 111th birthday!

282
00:24:30.803 --> 00:24:32.418
Happy birthday!

283
00:24:32.513 --> 00:24:36.882
But alas. eleventy-one years is
far too short a time to live among...

284
00:24:36.976 --> 00:24:39.888
Such excellent
and admirable hobbits:

285
00:24:40.854 --> 00:24:43.596
I don't know half of you
half as well as I should like

286
00:24:43.691 --> 00:24:48.355
and I like less than half of you
half as well as you deserve.

287
00:24:51.865 --> 00:24:53.480
L. uh...

288
00:24:58.330 --> 00:25:00.696
I have things to do.

289
00:25:07.089 --> 00:25:09.205
I've put this off far too long.

290
00:25:13.053 --> 00:25:17.012
I regret to announce this is the end!

291
00:25:18.183 --> 00:25:19.343
I'm going now.

292
00:25:20.436 --> 00:25:23.348
I bid you all a very fond farewell.

293
00:25:25.733 --> 00:25:26.939
Goodbye.

294
00:26:00.184 --> 00:26:03.347
I suppose you think
that was terribly clever.

295
00:26:03.437 --> 00:26:06.929
Come on. Gandalf.
Did you see their faces?

296
00:26:07.024 --> 00:26:12.189
There are many magic rings in this world.
and none of them should be used lightly.

297
00:26:12.279 --> 00:26:14.565
It was just a bit of fun.

298
00:26:14.656 --> 00:26:18.399
Oh. you're probably right. as usual.

299
00:26:19.787 --> 00:26:23.371
- You will keep an eye on Frodo. won't you?
- Two eyes.

300
00:26:23.457 --> 00:26:26.290
As often as I can spare them.

301
00:26:26.376 --> 00:26:29.664
- I'm leaving everything to him.
- What about this ring of yours?

302
00:26:29.755 --> 00:26:33.122
- Is that staying too?
- Yes. yes.

303
00:26:33.759 --> 00:26:37.627
It's in an envelope over there
on the mantelpiece.

304
00:26:38.722 --> 00:26:41.680
No. Walt. it's...

305
00:26:44.186 --> 00:26:46.848
Nere in my pocket.

306
00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:54.727
Isn't that...? Isn't that odd. now?

307
00:26:56.365 --> 00:26:59.857
Yet. after all. why not?

308
00:27:01.453 --> 00:27:06.322
- Why shouldn't I keep it?
- I think you should leave the ring behind.

309
00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:08.991
Is that so hard?

310
00:27:09.086 --> 00:27:10.451
Well. no.

311
00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:14.376
And yes.

312
00:27:16.343 --> 00:27:19.380
Now it comes to it.
I don't feel like parting with it.

313
00:27:19.638 --> 00:27:21.424
It's mine. I found it! It came to Mel

314
00:27:21.515 --> 00:27:25.804
- there's no need to get angry.
- Well. if I'm angry. it's your fault!

315
00:27:26.270 --> 00:27:28.056
It's mine.

316
00:27:29.314 --> 00:27:31.805
My own.

317
00:27:32.151 --> 00:27:36.190
My precious. Precious?

318
00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:39.272
It's been called that before.
but not by you.

319
00:27:39.366 --> 00:27:42.073
What business is it of yours
what I do with my own things?

320
00:27:42.161 --> 00:27:44.903
I think you've had that ring
quite long enough.

321
00:27:45.164 --> 00:27:48.076
- You want it for yourself!
- Bilbo Baggins!

322
00:27:48.167 --> 00:27:52.410
Do not take me for some conjurer
of cheap tricks.

323
00:27:52.671 --> 00:27:56.334
I am not trying to Rob you.

324
00:28:01.388 --> 00:28:03.094
I'm trying to help you.

325
00:28:11.565 --> 00:28:14.898
All your long years.
we've been friends.

326
00:28:15.277 --> 00:28:17.438
Trust me as you once did.

327
00:28:19.281 --> 00:28:21.112
Let it go.

328
00:28:22.242 --> 00:28:24.654
You're right. Gandalf.

329
00:28:26.788 --> 00:28:29.450
The ring must go to Frodo.

330
00:28:30.792 --> 00:28:33.829
It's late. The road is long.

331
00:28:33.921 --> 00:28:36.458
Yes. it is time.

332
00:28:39.301 --> 00:28:41.292
Bilbo. Hm?

333
00:28:41.803 --> 00:28:44.294
The ring is still in your pocket.

334
00:28:46.683 --> 00:28:48.594
Ah yes

335
00:29:19.007 --> 00:29:21.999
I've thought up an ending for my book:

336
00:29:23.679 --> 00:29:28.719
"And he lived happily ever after
to the end of his days."

337
00:29:28.809 --> 00:29:32.301
And I'm sure you will. my dear friend.

338
00:29:33.355 --> 00:29:34.811
Goodbye. Gandalf.

339
00:29:37.317 --> 00:29:40.184
Goodbye. dear bilbo.

340
00:29:47.995 --> 00:29:52.204
Bilbo:
The road goes ever on and on

341
00:29:54.751 --> 00:29:57.117
until our next meeting.

342
00:30:24.531 --> 00:30:28.240
Bilbo: It's mine. My own.

343
00:30:28.327 --> 00:30:31.785
My precious.

344
00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:35.072
Riddles in the dark.

345
00:30:35.167 --> 00:30:38.367
Bilbo!

346
00:30:42.007 --> 00:30:44.919
My precious.

347
00:30:46.553 --> 00:30:48.794
Precious.

348
00:30:48.889 --> 00:30:51.505
He's gone. hasn't he?

349
00:30:54.269 --> 00:30:57.306
He talked for so long about leaving...

350
00:30:57.564 --> 00:31:00.271
I didn't think he'd really do it.

351
00:31:04.738 --> 00:31:06.603
(Gandalf?

352
00:31:14.915 --> 00:31:16.576
Bilbo's ring.

353
00:31:16.917 --> 00:31:19.329
He's gone to stay with the elves.

354
00:31:19.419 --> 00:31:22.582
He's left you bag end.

355
00:31:26.176 --> 00:31:28.792
Along with all his possessions.

356
00:31:28.887 --> 00:31:31.799
The ring is yours now.

357
00:31:34.434 --> 00:31:37.972
- Put it somewhere out of sight.
- Where are you going?

358
00:31:38.063 --> 00:31:40.429
- There are some things that I must see to.
- What things?

359
00:31:40.524 --> 00:31:44.813
- Questions. Questions that need answering.
- You've only just arrived.

360
00:31:45.695 --> 00:31:48.311
I don't understand.

361
00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:52.660
Neither do I.

362
00:31:55.956 --> 00:31:58.322
Keep it secret.

363
00:31:58.417 --> 00:32:00.203
Keep it safe.

364
00:32:35.162 --> 00:32:37.369
Gollum: Shire!

365
00:32:37.706 --> 00:32:40.823
Baggins!

366
00:33:29.382 --> 00:33:32.340
Gandalf:
"The year 3434 of the second age.

367
00:33:32.427 --> 00:33:36.966
Here follows the account of isildur.
high king of gondor...

368
00:33:37.057 --> 00:33:40.766
And the finding
of the ring of power."

369
00:33:44.272 --> 00:33:46.137
"It has come to me.

370
00:33:46.233 --> 00:33:49.817
The one ring. It shall be
an heirloom of my kingdom.

371
00:33:49.903 --> 00:33:53.487
All those who follow in my bloodline
shall be bound to its fate

372
00:33:53.573 --> 00:33:57.486
Tor I will risk
no hurt to the ring.

373
00:33:57.577 --> 00:34:00.114
It is precious to me...

374
00:34:00.956 --> 00:34:03.618
Though I buy it with great pain.

375
00:34:06.753 --> 00:34:10.962
The markings upon the band
begin to fade.

376
00:34:11.299 --> 00:34:15.963
The writing. which at first was as clear
as red flame. has all but disappeared.

377
00:34:16.221 --> 00:34:20.260
A secret now
that only fire can tell."

378
00:34:36.783 --> 00:34:39.820
Shire.

379
00:34:39.911 --> 00:34:41.947
Baggins.

380
00:34:42.455 --> 00:34:46.494
There's no bagginses around here.
They're all up in hobbiton.

381
00:34:48.169 --> 00:34:49.659
That way.

382
00:34:55.677 --> 00:34:57.918
To heal my heart and drown my woe

383
00:34:58.013 --> 00:35:00.425
rain may fall and wind may blow

384
00:35:00.515 --> 00:35:02.551
but there still be

385
00:35:02.642 --> 00:35:04.223
many miles to go

386
00:35:04.311 --> 00:35:06.347
sweet is the sound of the pouring rain

387
00:35:06.438 --> 00:35:08.724
and the stream that falls
from hill to plain

388
00:35:08.815 --> 00:35:10.726
better than rain or rippling brook

389
00:35:10.817 --> 00:35:13.274
is a mug of beer inside this took

390
00:35:16.698 --> 00:35:19.531
there's been some strange folk
crossing the shire.

391
00:35:19.993 --> 00:35:23.827
Dwarves and others of a less
than savory nature.

392
00:35:24.331 --> 00:35:25.696
War is brewing.

393
00:35:26.374 --> 00:35:29.286
The mountains are fair teeming
with goblins.

394
00:35:29.377 --> 00:35:32.084
Far-off tales and children's stories.
that's all that is.

395
00:35:32.172 --> 00:35:36.757
You're beginning to sound like that old
bilbo Baggins. Cracked. he was.

396
00:35:36.843 --> 00:35:39.926
Young Mr. Frodo here.
he's cracking.

397
00:35:40.013 --> 00:35:41.549
And proud of it.

398
00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:43.972
- Cheers. gaffer.
- Cheers.

399
00:35:44.059 --> 00:35:48.268
It's none of our concern what goes on
beyond our borders.

400
00:35:48.355 --> 00:35:52.724
Keep your nose out of trouble.
and no trouble'll come to you.

401
00:35:56.071 --> 00:35:58.312
- Good night. lads.
- Good night.

402
00:35:58.406 --> 00:36:02.991
Good night. sweet maiden
of the golden ale.

403
00:36:03.078 --> 00:36:05.569
Mind who you're sweet-talking.

404
00:36:05.664 --> 00:36:10.249
Don't worry. Sam. Rosie knows an idiot
when she sees one.

405
00:36:11.252 --> 00:36:12.412
Does she?

406
00:36:13.088 --> 00:36:16.080
- Good night. Sam.
- Good night. Mr. Frodo.

407
00:36:40.865 --> 00:36:43.356
Is it secret? Is it safe?

408
00:36:49.124 --> 00:36:50.580
Ah

409
00:36:52.252 --> 00:36:54.368
What are you doing?

410
00:37:06.975 --> 00:37:09.512
Hold out your hand. Frodo.

411
00:37:09.602 --> 00:37:10.808
It's quite cool.

412
00:37:14.399 --> 00:37:16.139
What can you see?

413
00:37:17.986 --> 00:37:20.318
Can you see anything?

414
00:37:23.032 --> 00:37:24.488
Nothing.

415
00:37:25.118 --> 00:37:27.109
There's nothing.

416
00:37:28.163 --> 00:37:29.653
Wait

417
00:37:33.793 --> 00:37:36.000
there are markings.

418
00:37:37.505 --> 00:37:40.997
It's some form of elvish.
I can't read it

419
00:37:41.092 --> 00:37:43.674
there are few who can.

420
00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:49.055
The language is that of mordor.
which I will not utter here.

421
00:37:49.684 --> 00:37:50.719
Mordor!

422
00:37:51.019 --> 00:37:53.101
In the common tongue. it says:

423
00:37:53.188 --> 00:37:56.726
"One ring to rule them all...

424
00:37:57.025 --> 00:37:59.391
0one ring to find them...

425
00:37:59.486 --> 00:38:01.693
0one ring to bring them all...

426
00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:05.022
And in the darkness bind them."

427
00:38:06.659 --> 00:38:08.741
This is the one ring...

428
00:38:08.828 --> 00:38:14.243
Forged by the dark lord Sauron
in the fires of mount doom.

429
00:38:14.334 --> 00:38:18.373
Taken by isildur
from the hand of Sauron himself.

430
00:38:19.172 --> 00:38:21.709
Bilbo found it.

431
00:38:22.175 --> 00:38:24.086
In gollum's cave. Yes

432
00:38:24.344 --> 00:38:28.929
for 60 years. the ring lay quiet
in bilbo's keeping...

433
00:38:29.015 --> 00:38:32.473
Prolonging his life.
delaying old age.

434
00:38:33.102 --> 00:38:37.596
But no longer. Frodo.
Evil is stirring in mordor.

435
00:38:37.690 --> 00:38:40.102
The ring has awoken.

436
00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:43.147
It's heard its master's call.

437
00:38:43.238 --> 00:38:47.197
But he was destroyed.
Sauron was destroyed.

438
00:38:52.914 --> 00:38:54.996
Gandalf: No. Frodo.

439
00:38:55.917 --> 00:38:59.284
The spirit of Sauron endured.

440
00:38:59.379 --> 00:39:04.749
His life force is bound to the ring.
and the ring survived.

441
00:39:05.093 --> 00:39:07.254
Sauron has returned.

442
00:39:08.137 --> 00:39:10.298
His orcs have multiplied.

443
00:39:10.390 --> 00:39:14.508
His fortress at barad-dur
is rebuilt in the land of mordor.

444
00:39:14.602 --> 00:39:19.517
Sauron needs only this ring to cover
all the lands in a second darkness.

445
00:39:19.607 --> 00:39:21.814
He is seeking it.

446
00:39:21.901 --> 00:39:25.769
Seeking it. All his thought
is bent on it.

447
00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:28.817
For the ring yearns above all else...

448
00:39:28.908 --> 00:39:32.321
To return to the hand
of its master.

449
00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:34.406
They are one...

450
00:39:34.497 --> 00:39:37.660
The ring and the dark lord.

451
00:39:37.750 --> 00:39:38.830
Frodo

452
00:39:39.419 --> 00:39:41.330
he must never find it.

453
00:39:41.421 --> 00:39:42.536
Frodo: All right.

454
00:39:42.839 --> 00:39:47.208
We put it away. We keep it hidden.
We never speak of it again.

455
00:39:47.302 --> 00:39:50.044
No one knows it's here. do they?

456
00:39:55.685 --> 00:39:56.925
Do they. Gandalf?

457
00:39:57.979 --> 00:40:01.346
There is one other who knew
that bilbo had the ring.

458
00:40:02.650 --> 00:40:05.687
I looked everywhere
for the creature gollum.

459
00:40:05.778 --> 00:40:08.064
But the enemy found him first.

460
00:40:09.657 --> 00:40:12.239
Gandalf: I don't know how long
they tortured him.

461
00:40:12.327 --> 00:40:16.946
But amidst the endless screams and
inane babble. they discerned two words:

462
00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:19.247
Gollum: Shire!

463
00:40:19.334 --> 00:40:21.074
Baggins!

464
00:40:21.169 --> 00:40:23.080
Shire.

465
00:40:23.171 --> 00:40:26.163
Baggins. But that would
lead them here!

466
00:40:28.843 --> 00:40:30.003
Who goes there?

467
00:40:31.721 --> 00:40:32.961
Take it. Gandalf!

468
00:40:33.348 --> 00:40:34.463
- Take it!
- No. Frodo.

469
00:40:34.557 --> 00:40:37.048
- You must take it!
- You cannot offer me this ring!

470
00:40:37.143 --> 00:40:40.510
- I'm giving it to you!
- Don't tempt me. Frodo!

471
00:40:42.023 --> 00:40:44.230
I dare not take it.

472
00:40:44.609 --> 00:40:47.021
Not even to keep it safe.

473
00:40:48.196 --> 00:40:50.187
Understand. Frodo...

474
00:40:50.865 --> 00:40:54.483
I would use this ring
from a desire to do good.

475
00:40:59.874 --> 00:41:05.619
But through me. it would wield a power
too great and terrible to imagine.

476
00:41:06.214 --> 00:41:09.126
- But it cannot stay in the shire!
- No.

477
00:41:11.010 --> 00:41:12.625
No. it can't.

478
00:41:17.934 --> 00:41:19.344
What must I do?

479
00:41:21.020 --> 00:41:24.604
- You must leave. And leave quickly.
- Where? Where do I go?

480
00:41:24.691 --> 00:41:28.024
Get out of the shire.
Make for the village of Bree.

481
00:41:28.277 --> 00:41:29.437
Bree.

482
00:41:29.529 --> 00:41:32.441
- What about you?
- I'll be waiting for you...

483
00:41:32.532 --> 00:41:35.114
At the inn of the prancing pony.

484
00:41:35.201 --> 00:41:39.035
- And the ring will be safe there?
- I don't know. Frodo.

485
00:41:39.122 --> 00:41:41.158
I don't have any answers.

486
00:41:42.667 --> 00:41:48.287
I must see the head of my order. He is
both wise and powerful. Trust me. Frodo.

487
00:41:48.381 --> 00:41:50.542
He'll know what to do.

488
00:41:51.175 --> 00:41:53.962
You'll have to leave the name
of Baggins behind you.

489
00:41:54.262 --> 00:41:56.753
That name is not safe
outside the shire.

490
00:41:57.390 --> 00:42:00.678
Travel only by day.
And stay off the road.

491
00:42:01.310 --> 00:42:04.473
I can cut across country
easily enough.

492
00:42:06.983 --> 00:42:08.314
My dear Frodo.

493
00:42:08.609 --> 00:42:11.692
Hobbits really are amazing creatures.

494
00:42:11.779 --> 00:42:14.816
You can learn all that there is to
know about their ways in a month.

495
00:42:14.907 --> 00:42:17.364
And yet. after a hundred years...

496
00:42:17.452 --> 00:42:19.659
They can still surprise you.

497
00:42:21.205 --> 00:42:22.490
(Get down.

498
00:42:34.802 --> 00:42:38.294
Confound it all. samwise gamgee!
Have you been eavesdropping?

499
00:42:38.389 --> 00:42:42.974
I haven't been dropping no eaves. Honest.
I was cutting the grass under the window.

500
00:42:43.061 --> 00:42:45.598
A little late for trimming the verge.
don't you think?

501
00:42:45.688 --> 00:42:48.680
- I heard raised voices.
- What did you hear? Speak!

502
00:42:48.775 --> 00:42:49.855
Nothing important.

503
00:42:50.443 --> 00:42:54.607
That is. I heard a good deal about a ring.
a dark lord and the end of the world but...

504
00:42:54.697 --> 00:42:59.487
Please. Mr. Gandalf. sir. don't hurt me.
Don't turn me into anything unnatural.

505
00:43:00.161 --> 00:43:01.822
No?

506
00:43:02.997 --> 00:43:04.157
Perhaps not.

507
00:43:05.374 --> 00:43:08.832
I've thought of a better use for you.

508
00:43:10.546 --> 00:43:13.538
Gandalf:
Come along. samwise. Keep up.

509
00:43:15.051 --> 00:43:17.417
Be careful. both of you.

510
00:43:17.512 --> 00:43:20.424
The enemy has many spies
in his service:

511
00:43:20.515 --> 00:43:23.507
Birds. beasts.

512
00:43:25.269 --> 00:43:27.055
Is it safe?

513
00:43:28.773 --> 00:43:30.229
Never put it on...

514
00:43:30.316 --> 00:43:33.774
For the agents of the dark lord
will be drawn to its power.

515
00:43:33.861 --> 00:43:35.397
Always remember. Frodo...

516
00:43:35.905 --> 00:43:39.068
The ring is trying to get back
to its master.

517
00:43:39.492 --> 00:43:41.574
It wants to be found.

518
00:44:22.201 --> 00:44:24.408
This is it.

519
00:44:24.745 --> 00:44:26.906
This is what?

520
00:44:27.206 --> 00:44:29.242
If I take one more step...

521
00:44:29.750 --> 00:44:33.618
Itnl be the farthest away
from home I've ever been.

522
00:44:37.925 --> 00:44:39.415
Come on. Sam.

523
00:44:47.852 --> 00:44:49.638
Remember what bilbo used to say:

524
00:44:50.229 --> 00:44:54.017
- "It's a dangerous business. Frodo."
Bilbo: "Going out your door.

525
00:44:54.108 --> 00:44:58.647
You step onto the road.
and if you don't keep your feet...

526
00:44:58.738 --> 00:45:02.947
There's no knowing where
you might be swept off to."

527
00:45:16.964 --> 00:45:18.795
Sam.

528
00:45:22.303 --> 00:45:23.418
Wood-elves.

529
00:45:37.151 --> 00:45:40.643
They're going to the harbor
beyond the white towers.

530
00:45:41.197 --> 00:45:42.983
To the grey havens.

531
00:45:43.574 --> 00:45:45.656
Sam:
They're leaving middle-earth.

532
00:45:45.743 --> 00:45:47.984
Frodo: Never to return.

533
00:45:50.873 --> 00:45:52.989
I don't know why...

534
00:45:53.668 --> 00:45:56.080
It makes me sad.

535
00:45:58.172 --> 00:46:02.791
Everywhere I lie there's a dirty
great root sticking into my back.

536
00:46:03.511 --> 00:46:05.251
Just shut your eyes...

537
00:46:05.346 --> 00:46:08.213
And imagine you're back
in your own bed...

538
00:46:08.307 --> 00:46:12.300
With a soft mattress
and a lovely feather pillow.

539
00:46:21.612 --> 00:46:24.354
It's not working. Mr. Frodo.

540
00:46:24.448 --> 00:46:27.360
I'm never going to be able
to sleep out here.

541
00:46:29.704 --> 00:46:32.036
Me neither. Sam.

542
00:47:00.568 --> 00:47:03.651
Male voice: Smoke rises
from the mountain of doom.

543
00:47:03.738 --> 00:47:05.524
The hour grows late.

544
00:47:05.614 --> 00:47:09.277
And Gandalf the grey
rides to isengard...

545
00:47:09.368 --> 00:47:11.950
Seeking my counsel.

546
00:47:12.038 --> 00:47:16.122
For that is why you have come.
is it not?

547
00:47:16.208 --> 00:47:17.539
My old friend.

548
00:47:17.793 --> 00:47:19.408
Saruman.

549
00:47:24.216 --> 00:47:27.253
Saruman: You are sure of this?
Gandalf: Beyond any doubt.

550
00:47:28.054 --> 00:47:30.340
So the ring of power has been found.

551
00:47:30.431 --> 00:47:33.764
All these long years.
it was in the shire.

552
00:47:33.851 --> 00:47:37.059
- Under my very nose.
- Yet you did not have the wit to see it.

553
00:47:37.688 --> 00:47:42.182
Your love of the halfling's leaf
has clearly slowed your mind.

554
00:47:43.069 --> 00:47:47.108
But we still have time. Time enough
to counter Sauron if we act quickly.

555
00:47:47.198 --> 00:47:48.688
Time?

556
00:47:49.617 --> 00:47:52.233
What time do you think we have?

557
00:47:52.703 --> 00:47:56.616
Sauron has regained
much of his former strength.

558
00:47:56.707 --> 00:47:58.948
He cannot yet take physical form...

559
00:47:59.210 --> 00:48:01.917
But his spirit has lost
none of its potency.

560
00:48:02.588 --> 00:48:07.628
Concealed within his fortress.
the lord of mordor sees all

561
00:48:08.219 --> 00:48:14.135
his gaze pierces cloud. shadow.
earth and flesh.

562
00:48:15.643 --> 00:48:18.806
You know of what I speak. Gandalf.

563
00:48:19.730 --> 00:48:24.975
A great eye. lidless.
wreathed in flame.

564
00:48:25.945 --> 00:48:27.810
The eye of Sauron.

565
00:48:27.905 --> 00:48:30.612
He is gathering all evil to him.

566
00:48:30.699 --> 00:48:33.281
Very soon. he'll have summoned
an army great enough...

567
00:48:33.369 --> 00:48:35.610
For an assault upon middle-earth.

568
00:48:35.955 --> 00:48:38.321
You know this?

569
00:48:38.833 --> 00:48:40.323
How?

570
00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:42.621
I have seen it.

571
00:48:43.045 --> 00:48:46.253
A palantir is a dangerous tool.
saruman.

572
00:48:46.966 --> 00:48:48.456
Why?

573
00:48:48.926 --> 00:48:51.633
Why should we fear to use it?

574
00:48:54.265 --> 00:48:58.224
They are not all accounted for.
the lost seeing-stones.

575
00:48:58.310 --> 00:49:01.598
We do not know who else
may be watching.

576
00:49:04.191 --> 00:49:06.978
The hour is later than you think.

577
00:49:07.069 --> 00:49:09.435
Sauron's forces are already moving.

578
00:49:11.699 --> 00:49:14.441
The nine have left minas morgul.

579
00:49:14.827 --> 00:49:15.907
The nine?

580
00:49:15.995 --> 00:49:19.158
They crossed the river isen
on midsummer's Eve

581
00:49:19.248 --> 00:49:22.035
disguised as riders in black.

582
00:49:22.126 --> 00:49:26.119
- They've reached the shire?
- They will find the ring.

583
00:49:27.715 --> 00:49:29.956
And kill the one who carries it.

584
00:49:30.468 --> 00:49:31.958
Frodo!

585
00:49:44.565 --> 00:49:48.979
You did not seriously think that a hobbit
could contend with the will of Sauron?

586
00:49:49.737 --> 00:49:52.524
There are none who can.

587
00:49:55.034 --> 00:49:57.776
Against the power of mordor...

588
00:49:57.870 --> 00:50:00.577
There can be no victory.

589
00:50:02.541 --> 00:50:05.704
We must join with him. Gandalf.

590
00:50:07.004 --> 00:50:09.336
We must join with Sauron.

591
00:50:12.009 --> 00:50:14.671
It would be wise. my friend.

592
00:50:15.137 --> 00:50:16.627
Tell me.

593
00:50:16.722 --> 00:50:17.837
Friend

594
00:50:18.849 --> 00:50:23.388
when did saruman the wise
abandon reason for madness?

595
00:51:02.893 --> 00:51:04.599
I gave you the chance...

596
00:51:05.729 --> 00:51:08.436
Of aiding me willingly...

597
00:51:08.524 --> 00:51:12.733
But you have elected
the way of pain!

598
00:51:36.010 --> 00:51:37.500
Sam: Mr Frodo?

599
00:51:38.137 --> 00:51:39.923
Frodo? Frodo!

600
00:51:41.348 --> 00:51:44.636
- I thought I'd lost you.
- What are you talking about?

601
00:51:44.727 --> 00:51:47.764
- It's just something Gandalf said.
- What did he say?

602
00:51:48.606 --> 00:51:52.474
"Don't you lose him. samwise gamgee."
And I don't mean to.

603
00:51:52.735 --> 00:51:56.353
Sam. we're still in the shire.
What could possibly happen?

604
00:51:59.325 --> 00:52:00.360
Frodo.

605
00:52:00.618 --> 00:52:02.904
- Merry. it's Frodo Baggins.
- Hello. Frodo.

606
00:52:02.995 --> 00:52:04.451
(Get off him.

607
00:52:04.955 --> 00:52:06.491
Come on. Frodo.

608
00:52:06.582 --> 00:52:08.493
Frodo:
What's the meaning of this?

609
00:52:08.959 --> 00:52:10.699
You've been into farmer maggot's crop!

610
00:52:13.213 --> 00:52:15.329
Maggot: You get back here!

611
00:52:16.342 --> 00:52:17.707
Get out of my field!

612
00:52:17.801 --> 00:52:20.759
You'll know the devil
if I catch up with you!

613
00:52:20.846 --> 00:52:23.883
Merry: I don't know why he's so upset.
It's only a couple of carrots.

614
00:52:23.974 --> 00:52:25.180
Pippin: And some cabbages.

615
00:52:25.267 --> 00:52:28.259
And those three bags of potatoes
that we lifted last week.

616
00:52:28.354 --> 00:52:32.563
- And then the mushrooms the week before.
Merry: Yes. pippin. My point is...

617
00:52:32.650 --> 00:52:34.936
Ne's clearly overreacting.

618
00:52:35.027 --> 00:52:36.563
Run!

619
00:52:50.042 --> 00:52:52.579
Oh. that was close.

620
00:52:53.671 --> 00:52:56.788
I think I've broken something.

621
00:52:57.800 --> 00:53:00.212
Trust a brandybuck and a took!

622
00:53:00.302 --> 00:53:04.045
What? That was just a detour.
A short cut.

623
00:53:04.139 --> 00:53:06.425
- Short cut to what?
- Mushrooms!

624
00:53:15.192 --> 00:53:16.682
Pippin: That's mine.

625
00:53:19.446 --> 00:53:21.061
That's nice. merry.

626
00:53:21.615 --> 00:53:23.697
Merry: Here's a nice one. Sam.

627
00:53:23.784 --> 00:53:26.366
I think we should get off the road.

628
00:53:35.546 --> 00:53:37.002
(Set off the road!

629
00:53:37.089 --> 00:53:38.625
Quick!

630
00:53:51.311 --> 00:53:52.801
Be quiet!

631
00:54:59.129 --> 00:55:01.290
What was that?

632
00:55:33.997 --> 00:55:35.487
Sam: Anything?

633
00:55:36.166 --> 00:55:37.656
Nothing.

634
00:55:38.377 --> 00:55:40.663
What is going on?

635
00:55:41.213 --> 00:55:45.001
That black rider was looking
for something. Or someone.

636
00:55:46.343 --> 00:55:47.833
Frodo?

637
00:55:48.554 --> 00:55:49.589
(Set down!

638
00:56:06.530 --> 00:56:08.771
I have to leave the shire.

639
00:56:09.783 --> 00:56:12.149
Sam and I must get to Bree.

640
00:56:12.244 --> 00:56:13.700
Right.

641
00:56:15.080 --> 00:56:17.366
Bucklebury ferry. Follow me.

642
00:56:25.632 --> 00:56:26.997
Pippin: Run!

643
00:56:28.218 --> 00:56:30.209
Merry: This way! Follow me!

644
00:56:33.765 --> 00:56:34.800
Pippin: Run!

645
00:56:48.071 --> 00:56:49.811
Merry: Get the rope. Sam!

646
00:56:52.492 --> 00:56:54.028
Frodo!

647
00:56:54.745 --> 00:56:56.155
Pippin: Run. Frodo!

648
00:56:56.496 --> 00:56:57.656
Frodo: Go! Pippin: Hurry!

649
00:56:57.748 --> 00:57:00.410
Merry: Frodo. come on!

650
00:57:01.335 --> 00:57:03.326
Sam: Come on! Faster!
Pippin: Jump!

651
00:57:18.310 --> 00:57:22.519
- How far to the nearest crossing?
- The brandywine bridge. 20 miles.

652
00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:38.610
Come on.

653
00:57:49.800 --> 00:57:53.213
- What do you want?
- We're heading for the prancing pony.

654
00:57:56.723 --> 00:57:59.590
Hobbits. Four hobbits!

655
00:57:59.685 --> 00:58:03.678
What's more. out of the shire by your
talk. What business brings you to Bree?

656
00:58:04.106 --> 00:58:07.223
We wish to stay at the inn.
Our business is our own.

657
00:58:08.235 --> 00:58:10.851
All right. young sir.
I meant no offense.

658
00:58:10.946 --> 00:58:13.562
It's my job to ask questions
after nightfall.

659
00:58:13.657 --> 00:58:16.569
There's talk of strange folk abroad.

660
00:58:16.660 --> 00:58:18.867
Can't be too careful

661
00:58:38.598 --> 00:58:42.090
Out of the way!
Watch where you're walking.

662
00:59:06.251 --> 00:59:07.866
Fxcuse me.

663
00:59:08.879 --> 00:59:11.746
Good evening. little masters.
What can I do for you?

664
00:59:11.840 --> 00:59:18.052
If you're seeking accommodation. we got
some cozy hobbit-sized rooms available.

665
00:59:18.138 --> 00:59:22.802
Always proud to cater
to the little folk. mister...?

666
00:59:23.977 --> 00:59:26.013
Underhill. My name's underhill.

667
00:59:27.314 --> 00:59:29.851
- Underhill. yes.
- We're friends of Gandalf the grey.

668
00:59:29.941 --> 00:59:33.149
- Can you tell him we've arrived?
- Gandalf?

669
00:59:33.570 --> 00:59:35.310
(Sandalf.

670
00:59:36.156 --> 00:59:37.896
Oh. ves...

671
00:59:37.991 --> 00:59:40.152
I remember. Elderly chap.

672
00:59:40.494 --> 00:59:43.406
Big grey beard. pointy hat.

673
00:59:43.830 --> 00:59:45.661
Not seen him for six months.

674
00:59:52.422 --> 00:59:53.707
What do we do now?

675
01:00:00.931 --> 01:00:02.216
Sam.

676
01:00:02.307 --> 01:00:04.218
He'll be here. He'll come.

677
01:00:07.020 --> 01:00:09.056
Man: Get out of my way!

678
01:00:11.441 --> 01:00:13.102
What's that?

679
01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:15.897
This. my friend. is a pint.

680
01:00:15.987 --> 01:00:17.693
It comes in pints?

681
01:00:18.031 --> 01:00:21.740
- I'm getting one.
- You got a whole half already!

682
01:00:28.083 --> 01:00:31.917
That fellow's done nothing
but stare at you since we arrived.

683
01:00:35.465 --> 01:00:36.955
Fxcuse me.

684
01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:41.752
That man in the corner. Who is he?

685
01:00:42.931 --> 01:00:47.345
He's one of them rangers. They're
dangerous folk. wandering the wilds.

686
01:00:47.602 --> 01:00:52.096
What his right name is. I've never heard.
but around here he's known as strider.

687
01:00:54.484 --> 01:00:55.724
Strider.

688
01:01:08.748 --> 01:01:11.956
Voice of the ring: Baggins.

689
01:01:14.796 --> 01:01:16.957
Baggins.

690
01:01:22.345 --> 01:01:27.465
Baggins. Baggins.

691
01:01:29.311 --> 01:01:31.597
Pippin:
Baggins? Sure. I know a Baggins.

692
01:01:32.397 --> 01:01:35.309
He's over there. Frodo Baggins.

693
01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:38.517
He's my second cousin.
once removed on his mother's side

694
01:01:38.612 --> 01:01:40.944
and my third cousin. twice removed...

695
01:01:45.452 --> 01:01:47.192
- Pippin!
- Steady on. Frodo.

696
01:02:16.733 --> 01:02:19.190
Sauron: You cannot hide.

697
01:02:22.155 --> 01:02:25.318
I see you.

698
01:02:26.993 --> 01:02:29.735
There is no life.

699
01:02:29.829 --> 01:02:32.115
In the void.

700
01:02:32.207 --> 01:02:33.743
Only...

701
01:02:34.668 --> 01:02:36.158
Death.

702
01:02:42.175 --> 01:02:47.044
You draw far too much attention
to yourself. "Mr. underhill."

703
01:02:51.726 --> 01:02:52.841
What do you want?

704
01:02:52.936 --> 01:02:55.336
A little more caution from you.
That is no trinket you carry.

705
01:02:55.397 --> 01:02:58.389
I carry nothing. Indeed.

706
01:02:58.692 --> 01:03:01.274
I can avoid being seen if I wish...

707
01:03:01.361 --> 01:03:05.104
But to disappear entirely.
that is a rare qift.

708
01:03:05.615 --> 01:03:08.231
- Who are you?
- Are you frightened?

709
01:03:09.494 --> 01:03:10.574
Yes

710
01:03:10.662 --> 01:03:14.621
not nearly frightened enough.
I know what hunts you.

711
01:03:18.628 --> 01:03:21.165
Let him go!
Or I'll have you. longshanks.

712
01:03:22.841 --> 01:03:27.005
You have a stout heart. little hobbit.
But that will not save you.

713
01:03:27.095 --> 01:03:30.087
You can no longer wait
for the wizard. Frodo.

714
01:03:30.181 --> 01:03:31.216
They're coming.

715
01:04:54.933 --> 01:04:56.423
What are they?

716
01:04:58.603 --> 01:05:00.719
They were once men.

717
01:05:01.231 --> 01:05:03.517
Great kings of men.

718
01:05:03.608 --> 01:05:06.816
Then Sauron the deceiver gave to them
nine rings of power.

719
01:05:07.404 --> 01:05:10.487
Blinded by their greed.
they took them without question.

720
01:05:10.740 --> 01:05:14.107
One by one. falling into darkness.

721
01:05:14.202 --> 01:05:16.739
Now they are slaves to his will.

722
01:05:19.124 --> 01:05:20.864
They are the nazgul.

723
01:05:20.959 --> 01:05:23.746
Ringwraiths. Neither living nor dead.

724
01:05:24.504 --> 01:05:25.994
At all times they feel...

725
01:05:26.089 --> 01:05:28.125
The presence of the ring...

726
01:05:28.216 --> 01:05:32.801
Drawn to the power of the one.
They will never stop hunting you.

727
01:05:42.772 --> 01:05:45.684
Frodo: Where are you taking us?
Into the wild.

728
01:05:53.867 --> 01:05:58.031
How do we know this strider
is a friend of Gandalf?

729
01:05:58.121 --> 01:06:00.988
I think a servant of the enemy
would look fairer

730
01:06:01.374 --> 01:06:05.287
- and feel fouler.
- He's foul enough.

731
01:06:05.879 --> 01:06:08.746
We have no choice but to trust him.

732
01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:12.332
- But where is he leading us?
Strider: To rivendell. master gamgee.

733
01:06:14.721 --> 01:06:18.009
- To the house of elrond.
Sam: Did you hear that? Rivendell.

734
01:06:18.558 --> 01:06:21.345
We're going to see the elves.

735
01:06:42.999 --> 01:06:47.288
Gentlemen. we do not stop till nightfall.
What about breakfast?

736
01:06:47.378 --> 01:06:50.120
- You've already had it.
- We've had one. ves.

737
01:06:50.215 --> 01:06:52.501
What about second breakfast?

738
01:06:55.929 --> 01:06:59.137
Don't think he knows
about second breakfast. pip.

739
01:06:59.224 --> 01:07:04.594
What about elevenses? Luncheon?
Afternoon tea? Dinner? Supper?

740
01:07:04.687 --> 01:07:08.896
- He knows about them. doesn't he?
- I wouldn't count on it.

741
01:07:14.364 --> 01:07:15.945
Merry: Pippin!

742
01:07:32.465 --> 01:07:35.957
What do they eat
when they can't get hobbit?

743
01:08:14.632 --> 01:08:16.839
Who is she?

744
01:08:17.510 --> 01:08:20.126
This woman you sing of.

745
01:08:23.516 --> 01:08:26.007
"Tis the lady of luthien.

746
01:08:26.102 --> 01:08:31.313
The elf-maiden who gave her love
to beren. a mortal.

747
01:08:33.151 --> 01:08:35.267
What happened to her?

748
01:08:37.488 --> 01:08:39.979
She died.

749
01:08:44.037 --> 01:08:46.369
Get some sleep. Frodo.

750
01:08:56.633 --> 01:09:00.751
Saruman: The power of isengard
is at your command...

751
01:09:00.845 --> 01:09:05.339
Oauron. lord of the earth.

752
01:09:08.686 --> 01:09:14.477
Sauron:
Build me an army worthy of mordor.

753
01:09:20.198 --> 01:09:24.658
What orders from mordor. my lord?
What does the eye command?

754
01:09:25.078 --> 01:09:27.034
We have work to do.

755
01:10:09.622 --> 01:10:14.241
The trees are strong. my lord.
Their roots go deep.

756
01:10:14.627 --> 01:10:16.458
Rip them all down.

757
01:10:43.906 --> 01:10:46.773
This was the great watchtower
of amon sil

758
01:10:48.494 --> 01:10:51.156
we shall rest here tonight.

759
01:11:02.884 --> 01:11:06.376
These are for you.
Keep them close.

760
01:11:06.471 --> 01:11:09.008
I'm going to have a look around.

761
01:11:11.392 --> 01:11:13.303
Stay here.

762
01:11:15.855 --> 01:11:18.016
Merry: My tomato's burst.

763
01:11:18.274 --> 01:11:20.230
Pippin: Could I have some bacon?

764
01:11:20.318 --> 01:11:22.309
Merry: Want a tomato. Sam?

765
01:11:22.695 --> 01:11:26.404
- What are you doing?!
- Tomatoes. sausages. nice crispy bacon.

766
01:11:26.491 --> 01:11:29.358
Sam: We saved some for you. Mr. Frodo.
Frodo: Put it out. you fools!

767
01:11:29.452 --> 01:11:33.491
- Put it out!
Pippin: That's nice! Ash on my tomatoes!

768
01:11:41.923 --> 01:11:43.663
(Go!

769
01:12:37.103 --> 01:12:38.559
Back. you devils!

770
01:14:02.063 --> 01:14:03.303
Frodo!

771
01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:09.191
- Frodo.
- Oh. Sam.

772
01:14:46.232 --> 01:14:47.232
Strider!

773
01:14:50.027 --> 01:14:55.522
- Help him. strider.
- He's been stabbed by a morgul blade.

774
01:14:57.034 --> 01:15:01.903
This is beyond my skill to heal.
He needs elvish medicine.

775
01:15:06.502 --> 01:15:07.617
Hurry!

776
01:15:07.712 --> 01:15:11.796
We're six days from rivendell!
He'll never make it!

777
01:15:11.882 --> 01:15:13.747
Hold on. Frodo.

778
01:15:15.553 --> 01:15:16.588
(Gandalf!

779
01:17:54.295 --> 01:17:57.378
Look. Frodo. It's Mr. bilbo's trolls.

780
01:17:59.550 --> 01:18:02.383
Mr. Frodo? He's going cold.

781
01:18:05.347 --> 01:18:07.178
Is he going to die?

782
01:18:07.266 --> 01:18:12.181
He's passing into the shadow world.
He'll soon become a wraith like them.

783
01:18:17.359 --> 01:18:21.227
- They're close.
- Sam. do you know the athelas plant?

784
01:18:21.322 --> 01:18:22.903
- Athelas?
- Kingsfoil.

785
01:18:22.990 --> 01:18:24.196
Kingsfoll. aye. it's a weed.

786
01:18:24.283 --> 01:18:27.446
It may help to slow the poisoning.
Hurry!

787
01:18:41.842 --> 01:18:45.960
Female: What's this?
A ranger caught off his guard?

788
01:19:10.871 --> 01:19:11.906
Frodo.

789
01:19:28.847 --> 01:19:30.678
Who is she?

790
01:19:31.350 --> 01:19:33.090
Frodo.

791
01:19:33.352 --> 01:19:36.844
- She's an elf.
- He's fading.

792
01:19:39.108 --> 01:19:41.349
He's not going to last.

793
01:19:41.443 --> 01:19:44.150
We must get him to my father.

794
01:19:44.905 --> 01:19:47.817
- I've been looking for you for two days.
- Where are you taking him?

795
01:19:47.908 --> 01:19:54.029
There are five wraiths behind you.
Where the other four are. I do not know.

796
01:20:01.880 --> 01:20:03.211
What are they saying?

797
01:20:03.299 --> 01:20:05.335
Arwen:

798
01:20:09.221 --> 01:20:10.882
I do not fear them.

799
01:20:20.733 --> 01:20:22.189
Arwen.

800
01:20:22.276 --> 01:20:25.518
Ride hard. Don't look back.

801
01:20:30.576 --> 01:20:34.945
What are you doing?!
Those wraiths are still out there!

802
01:22:29.570 --> 01:22:32.277
Give up the halfling. she-elf.

803
01:22:33.198 --> 01:22:35.780
If you want him. come and claim him.

804
01:23:29.671 --> 01:23:32.162
No. No!

805
01:23:35.427 --> 01:23:37.793
Frodo. no.

806
01:23:37.888 --> 01:23:40.300
Frodo. don't give in.

807
01:23:40.390 --> 01:23:42.426
Not now.

808
01:23:53.362 --> 01:23:55.853
Arwen: What grace is given me...

809
01:23:56.532 --> 01:23:58.363
Let it pass to him.

810
01:23:58.617 --> 01:24:00.733
Let him be spared.

811
01:24:01.370 --> 01:24:03.406
Save him.

812
01:24:15.801 --> 01:24:20.966
- Where am 1?
Gandalf: You are in the house of elrond.

813
01:24:21.431 --> 01:24:27.927
And it is 10:00 in the morning
on October 24th. if you want to know.

814
01:24:29.898 --> 01:24:33.686
- Gandalf!
- Yes. I'm here.

815
01:24:35.320 --> 01:24:38.403
And you're lucky to be here too.

816
01:24:39.074 --> 01:24:43.158
A few more hours and you
would have been beyond our aid.

817
01:24:43.245 --> 01:24:47.409
But you have some strength in you.
my dear hobbit.

818
01:24:55.007 --> 01:24:57.498
What happened. Gandalf?

819
01:24:58.468 --> 01:25:03.838
- Why didn't you meet us?
- I am sorry. Frodo.

820
01:25:08.604 --> 01:25:10.344
I was delayed.

821
01:25:11.231 --> 01:25:15.440
A friendship with saruman
is not lightly thrown aside.

822
01:25:19.531 --> 01:25:24.195
One ill turn deserves another.
It is over.

823
01:25:24.494 --> 01:25:27.236
Embrace the power of the ring...

824
01:25:27.789 --> 01:25:30.326
Or embrace your own destruction!

825
01:25:32.628 --> 01:25:36.496
Gandalf:
There is only one lord of the ring.

826
01:25:36.757 --> 01:25:40.750
Only one who can bend it to his will.

827
01:25:41.553 --> 01:25:45.512
And he does not share power.

828
01:25:59.863 --> 01:26:03.230
So you have chosen death.

829
01:26:13.293 --> 01:26:17.081
Gandalf? What is it?

830
01:26:18.048 --> 01:26:19.834
Nothing. Frodo.

831
01:26:20.509 --> 01:26:22.420
Sam: Frodo!

832
01:26:22.511 --> 01:26:23.671
Frodo!

833
01:26:23.762 --> 01:26:26.253
- Sam.
- Bless you. you're awake!

834
01:26:26.348 --> 01:26:29.090
Sam has hardly left your side.

835
01:26:29.351 --> 01:26:31.551
We were that worried about you.
Weren't we. Mr. Gandalf?

836
01:26:31.895 --> 01:26:37.015
By the skills of lord elrond.
you're beginning to mend.

837
01:26:38.527 --> 01:26:42.111
Welcome to rivendell. Frodo Baggins.

838
01:27:30.162 --> 01:27:33.529
Frodo: Bilbo!
- Hello. Frodo. my lad.

839
01:27:33.623 --> 01:27:35.363
Bilbo.

840
01:27:40.380 --> 01:27:42.120
Frodo: "There and back again:

841
01:27:42.382 --> 01:27:45.124
A hobbit's tale. by bilbo Baggins."

842
01:27:48.180 --> 01:27:51.764
- This is wonderful.
- I meant to go back...

843
01:27:52.100 --> 01:27:55.888
Wonder at the powers of Mirkwood...

844
01:27:56.354 --> 01:27:58.640
Visit lake-town.

845
01:27:58.899 --> 01:28:02.266
See the lonely mountain again.

846
01:28:02.694 --> 01:28:07.609
But age. it seems.
has finally caught up with me.

847
01:28:19.711 --> 01:28:21.497
Frodo: I miss the shire.

848
01:28:21.922 --> 01:28:27.042
I spent all my childhood pretending
I was off somewhere else.

849
01:28:27.385 --> 01:28:30.969
Off with you.
on one of your adventures.

850
01:28:33.934 --> 01:28:37.518
But my own adventure turned out
to be quite different.

851
01:28:42.734 --> 01:28:45.942
I'm not like you. bilbo.

852
01:28:47.072 --> 01:28:49.404
My dear boy.

853
01:28:53.495 --> 01:28:57.454
Sam: Now. what have I forgotten?
- Packed already?

854
01:28:58.250 --> 01:29:00.115
No harm in being prepared.

855
01:29:00.210 --> 01:29:02.872
- I thought you wanted to see the elves.
- I do.

856
01:29:02.963 --> 01:29:05.955
- More than anything.
- I did.

857
01:29:06.049 --> 01:29:08.005
It's just...

858
01:29:08.760 --> 01:29:11.467
We did what Gandalf wanted. didn't we?

859
01:29:11.555 --> 01:29:15.343
We got the ring this far.
to rivendell. And I thought...

860
01:29:15.433 --> 01:29:18.846
Seeing as how you're on the mend.
we'd be off soon.

861
01:29:18.937 --> 01:29:20.677
Off home.

862
01:29:24.860 --> 01:29:26.851
You are right. Sam.

863
01:29:29.030 --> 01:29:31.772
We did what we set out to do.

864
01:29:32.367 --> 01:29:34.949
The ring will be safe in rivendell.

865
01:29:39.040 --> 01:29:41.372
I am ready to go home.

866
01:29:42.127 --> 01:29:44.243
Elrond: His strength returns.

867
01:29:44.337 --> 01:29:50.082
That wound will never fully heal.
He will carry it the rest of his life.

868
01:29:50.635 --> 01:29:53.251
And yet to have come so far
still bearing the ring...

869
01:29:53.346 --> 01:29:57.180
The hobbit has shown extraordinary
resilience to its evil

870
01:29:57.267 --> 01:30:00.634
it is a burden he should never
have had to bear.

871
01:30:00.896 --> 01:30:06.391
- We can ask no more of Frodo.
- Gandalf. the enemy is moving.

872
01:30:06.484 --> 01:30:11.148
Sauron's forces are massing in the east.
His eye is fixed on rivendell.

873
01:30:11.406 --> 01:30:14.193
And saruman. you tell me. has betrayed us.

874
01:30:14.284 --> 01:30:17.572
Our list of allies grows thin.

875
01:30:18.330 --> 01:30:21.197
His treachery runs deeper
than you know.

876
01:30:21.291 --> 01:30:25.034
By foul craft. saruman
has crossed orcs with goblin-men.

877
01:30:25.128 --> 01:30:27.619
He's breeding an army
in the caverns of isengard.

878
01:30:27.923 --> 01:30:32.542
An army that can move in sunlight
and cover great distance at speed.

879
01:30:32.636 --> 01:30:35.093
Saruman is coming for the ring.

880
01:30:35.555 --> 01:30:39.673
This evil cannot be concealed
by the power of the elves.

881
01:30:39.768 --> 01:30:44.182
We do not have the strength
to fight both mordor and isengard!

882
01:30:48.026 --> 01:30:49.106
Gandalf

883
01:30:50.445 --> 01:30:53.027
the ring cannot stay here.

884
01:31:12.550 --> 01:31:15.713
Elrond: This peril belongs
to all middle-earth.

885
01:31:15.971 --> 01:31:18.678
They must decide now how to end it.

886
01:31:19.724 --> 01:31:23.308
The time of the elves is over.
My people are leaving these shores.

887
01:31:23.979 --> 01:31:27.597
Who will you look to when we've gone?
The dwarves?

888
01:31:27.691 --> 01:31:32.856
They hide in mountains seeking riches.
They care not for the troubles of others.

889
01:31:34.489 --> 01:31:37.322
It is in men
that we must place our hope.

890
01:31:37.659 --> 01:31:39.365
Men?

891
01:31:40.245 --> 01:31:43.533
Men are weak.
The race of men is failing.

892
01:31:43.623 --> 01:31:48.117
The blood of numenor is all but spent.
its pride and dignity forgotten.

893
01:31:48.420 --> 01:31:52.004
It is because of men
the ring survives.

894
01:31:52.090 --> 01:31:53.751
I was there. Gandalf.

895
01:31:54.426 --> 01:31:57.259
I was there 3000 years ago...

896
01:32:04.102 --> 01:32:06.559
When [isildur took the ring.

897
01:32:06.646 --> 01:32:10.605
I was there the day
the strength of men failed.

898
01:32:13.153 --> 01:32:15.690
Isildur. hurry! Follow me.

899
01:32:17.282 --> 01:32:20.900
Elrond: [ Led isildur into the heart
of mount doom.

900
01:32:21.161 --> 01:32:24.745
Where the ring was forgea.
the one place it could be destroyed.

901
01:32:24.831 --> 01:32:27.447
Cast it into the fire!

902
01:32:32.630 --> 01:32:36.418
- Destroy it!
- No_

903
01:32:37.761 --> 01:32:39.922
Isildur!

904
01:32:40.388 --> 01:32:45.132
Elrond: It should have ended that day.
but evil was allowed to endure.

905
01:32:49.230 --> 01:32:53.473
Isildur kept the ring.
The line of kings is broken.

906
01:32:54.402 --> 01:32:58.111
There's no strength left
in the world of men.

907
01:32:58.198 --> 01:33:03.158
- They're scattered. divided. leaderless.
- There is one who could unite them.

908
01:33:03.244 --> 01:33:06.657
One who could reclaim
the throne of gondor.

909
01:33:08.333 --> 01:33:12.201
He turned from that path
a long time ago.

910
01:33:12.295 --> 01:33:14.456
He has chosen exile.

911
01:33:45.703 --> 01:33:47.739
You are no elf

912
01:33:47.831 --> 01:33:49.947
men of the south are welcome here

913
01:33:50.542 --> 01:33:54.034
- who are you?
- I am a friend to Gandalf the grey.

914
01:33:55.547 --> 01:33:58.380
Then we are here on common purpose...

915
01:33:58.758 --> 01:34:00.214
Friend.

916
01:34:15.400 --> 01:34:18.312
The shards of narsil.

917
01:34:21.781 --> 01:34:26.241
The blade that cut the ring
from Sauron's hand.

918
01:34:29.164 --> 01:34:31.405
It's still sharp.

919
01:34:40.300 --> 01:34:43.383
But no more than a broken heirloom.

920
01:35:10.205 --> 01:35:13.242
Why do you fear the past?

921
01:35:14.125 --> 01:35:19.461
You are isildur's herr.
not isildur himself

922
01:35:19.714 --> 01:35:23.127
you are not bound to his fate

923
01:35:23.635 --> 01:35:27.628
the same blood flows in my veins.

924
01:35:30.642 --> 01:35:33.224
The same weakness.

925
01:35:35.939 --> 01:35:38.806
Your time will come.

926
01:35:38.900 --> 01:35:43.314
You will face the same evil.
And you will defeat it.

927
01:36:33.871 --> 01:36:36.533
You said you'd bind yourself to me...

928
01:36:38.543 --> 01:36:43.537
Forsaking the immortal life
of your people.

929
01:36:44.674 --> 01:36:46.585
And to that I hold.

930
01:36:46.676 --> 01:36:50.339
I would rather share
one lifetime with you...

931
01:36:50.596 --> 01:36:54.464
Than face all the ages
of this world alone.

932
01:37:03.234 --> 01:37:06.692
I choose a mortal life.

933
01:37:08.031 --> 01:37:12.274
- You cannot give me this.
- It is mine to give to whom I will...

934
01:37:15.538 --> 01:37:18.029
Llke my heart.

935
01:37:33.806 --> 01:37:37.594
Elrond: Strangers from distant lands.
friends of old.

936
01:37:37.685 --> 01:37:41.644
You've been summoned here
to answer the threat of mordor.

937
01:37:42.273 --> 01:37:47.142
Middle-earth stands upon the brink
of destruction. None can escape it.

938
01:37:47.403 --> 01:37:50.987
You will unite. or you will fall.

939
01:37:51.074 --> 01:37:55.408
Each race is bound to this fate.
this one doom.

940
01:37:57.246 --> 01:38:00.738
Bring forth the ring. Frodo.

941
01:38:14.806 --> 01:38:16.546
So it is true.

942
01:38:33.991 --> 01:38:36.107
In a dream

943
01:38:37.703 --> 01:38:40.820
I saw the eastern sky grow dark...

944
01:38:41.124 --> 01:38:42.830
But in the west
a pale light lingered.

945
01:38:43.626 --> 01:38:45.366
A voice was crying:

946
01:38:45.670 --> 01:38:48.582
"Your doom is near at hand.

947
01:38:49.590 --> 01:38:52.332
Isildur's bane is found."

948
01:38:56.347 --> 01:38:58.178
Isildur's bane.

949
01:38:58.850 --> 01:39:00.215
Boromir!

950
01:39:23.332 --> 01:39:27.200
Never before has any voice uttered the
words of that tongue here in imladris.

951
01:39:27.295 --> 01:39:31.083
I do not ask your pardon.
master elrond.

952
01:39:31.174 --> 01:39:33.335
For the black speech of mordor...

953
01:39:33.634 --> 01:39:35.044
May yet be heard...

954
01:39:35.136 --> 01:39:38.219
In every corner of the west!

955
01:39:38.306 --> 01:39:41.013
The ring is altogether evil.

956
01:39:41.350 --> 01:39:42.840
It is a gift.

957
01:39:43.436 --> 01:39:45.518
A qift to the foes of mordor.

958
01:39:46.147 --> 01:39:48.308
Why not use this ring?

959
01:39:48.399 --> 01:39:51.266
Long has my father.
the steward of gondor

960
01:39:51.360 --> 01:39:55.729
kept the forces of mordor at bay.
By the blood of our people...

961
01:39:56.032 --> 01:39:58.239
Are your lands kept safe.

962
01:40:00.036 --> 01:40:04.370
Give gondor the weapon of the enemy.
Let us use it against him.

963
01:40:04.665 --> 01:40:08.408
You cannot wield it.
None of us can.

964
01:40:09.045 --> 01:40:13.129
The one ring answers to Sauron alone.
It has no other master:

965
01:40:13.216 --> 01:40:16.800
And what would a ranger know
of this matter?

966
01:40:17.094 --> 01:40:19.085
This is no mere ranger.

967
01:40:20.097 --> 01:40:23.760
He is aragorn. son of arathorn.

968
01:40:24.268 --> 01:40:27.180
You owe him your allegiance.

969
01:40:31.275 --> 01:40:33.186
Aragorn.

970
01:40:34.946 --> 01:40:37.779
This is isildur's heir?

971
01:40:40.117 --> 01:40:42.824
And heir to the throne of gondor.

972
01:40:49.794 --> 01:40:52.627
Gondor has no king.

973
01:40:54.465 --> 01:40:56.126
Gondor needs no king.

974
01:41:02.807 --> 01:41:06.470
Aragorn is right. We cannot use it.

975
01:41:07.478 --> 01:41:10.970
You have only one choice.

976
01:41:11.232 --> 01:41:13.598
The ring must be destroyed.

977
01:41:18.823 --> 01:41:21.360
What are we waiting for?

978
01:41:33.504 --> 01:41:36.496
The ring cannot be destroyed. gimli.
son of gloin.

979
01:41:36.757 --> 01:41:41.000
By any craft that we here possess.

980
01:41:41.512 --> 01:41:45.721
The ring was made in the fires
of mount doom.

981
01:41:45.808 --> 01:41:49.676
Only there can it be unmade.

982
01:41:50.730 --> 01:41:53.392
It must be taken deep into mordor...

983
01:41:53.482 --> 01:41:57.350
And cast back into the fiery chasm
from whence it came.

984
01:42:00.531 --> 01:42:02.522
One of you...

985
01:42:03.034 --> 01:42:05.195
Must do this.

986
01:42:08.122 --> 01:42:11.831
One does not simply walk into mordor.

987
01:42:12.710 --> 01:42:16.373
Its black gates are guarded
by more than just orcs.

988
01:42:17.214 --> 01:42:21.423
There is evil there
that does not sleep.

989
01:42:21.510 --> 01:42:25.753
The great eye is ever-watchful.

990
01:42:26.557 --> 01:42:28.639
It is a barren wasteland.

991
01:42:28.726 --> 01:42:32.435
Riddled with fire. and ash
and dust.

992
01:42:32.521 --> 01:42:36.389
The very air you breathe
is a poisonous fume.

993
01:42:36.651 --> 01:42:40.894
Not with 10.000 men
could you do this. It is folly.

994
01:42:41.155 --> 01:42:45.649
Have you heard nothing lord elrond
has said? The ring must be destroyed.

995
01:42:45.743 --> 01:42:48.450
And I suppose you think
you are the one to do it!

996
01:42:48.537 --> 01:42:53.281
And if we fail. what then? What happens
when Sauron takes back what is his?

997
01:42:53.376 --> 01:42:58.791
I will be dead before I see the ring
in the hands of an elf!

998
01:43:00.716 --> 01:43:03.253
Never trust an elf!

999
01:43:04.428 --> 01:43:10.264
Gandalf: Do you not understand?
While you bicker. Sauron's power grows!

1000
01:43:10.601 --> 01:43:13.434
None can escape it!
You'll all be destroyed!

1001
01:43:32.248 --> 01:43:34.455
I will take it.

1002
01:43:36.460 --> 01:43:38.951
I will take it.

1003
01:43:44.802 --> 01:43:47.839
I will take the ring to mordor.

1004
01:43:55.896 --> 01:43:57.136
Though...

1005
01:44:00.234 --> 01:44:02.065
I do not know the way.

1006
01:44:04.071 --> 01:44:08.440
I will help you bear
this burden. Frodo Baggins...

1007
01:44:08.534 --> 01:44:11.947
As long as it is yours to bear.

1008
01:44:13.080 --> 01:44:16.163
If by my life
or death I can protect you...

1009
01:44:16.917 --> 01:44:18.248
I will

1010
01:44:21.464 --> 01:44:23.750
you have my sword.

1011
01:44:25.593 --> 01:44:27.675
And you have my bow.

1012
01:44:37.772 --> 01:44:40.764
You carry the fates
of us all. little one.

1013
01:44:42.777 --> 01:44:46.440
If this is indeed
the will of the council.

1014
01:44:46.906 --> 01:44:49.318
- Then gondor will see it done.
- Hey!

1015
01:44:51.952 --> 01:44:56.787
- Frodo's not going anywhere without me.
- It is hardly possible to separate you...

1016
01:44:56.874 --> 01:45:01.789
Even when he is summoned
to a secret council and you are not.

1017
01:45:02.296 --> 01:45:04.252
We're coming too!

1018
01:45:06.383 --> 01:45:09.125
You'll have to send us home
tied up in a sack to stop us.

1019
01:45:09.386 --> 01:45:12.719
Anyway. you need people
of intelligence on this sort of...

1020
01:45:13.057 --> 01:45:14.422
Mission.

1021
01:45:14.517 --> 01:45:16.053
Quest.

1022
01:45:16.519 --> 01:45:17.554
Thing.

1023
01:45:19.396 --> 01:45:22.058
Well. that rules you out. pip.

1024
01:45:23.651 --> 01:45:25.562
Nine companions.

1025
01:45:27.404 --> 01:45:29.235
So be it

1026
01:45:29.573 --> 01:45:32.565
you shall be
the fellowship of the ring.

1027
01:45:33.244 --> 01:45:35.155
Great!

1028
01:45:35.246 --> 01:45:37.578
Where are we going?

1029
01:46:19.958 --> 01:46:22.495
Elrond:

1030
01:46:24.421 --> 01:46:28.209
Elrond:

1031
01:46:30.636 --> 01:46:34.128
In her heart. your mother
knew you'd be hunted all your life.

1032
01:46:34.640 --> 01:46:36.301
That you'd never escape your fate.

1033
01:46:36.808 --> 01:46:40.471
The skill of the elves
can reforge the sword of kings...

1034
01:46:40.896 --> 01:46:44.809
But only you have the power
to wield it.

1035
01:46:45.817 --> 01:46:48.308
I do not want that power.

1036
01:46:48.487 --> 01:46:51.149
I have never wanted it.

1037
01:46:52.491 --> 01:46:55.107
You are the last of that bloodline.
There is no other.

1038
01:46:59.498 --> 01:47:01.830
Bilbo: My old sword! Sting.

1039
01:47:02.042 --> 01:47:03.157
Here. take it. Take it.

1040
01:47:08.674 --> 01:47:12.633
- It's so light.
- Yes. Made by the elves. you know.

1041
01:47:13.345 --> 01:47:17.429
The blade glows blue
when orcs are close.

1042
01:47:17.641 --> 01:47:22.180
And it's times like that. my lad.
when you have to be extra careful.

1043
01:47:22.396 --> 01:47:24.853
Here's a pretty thing.

1044
01:47:25.273 --> 01:47:26.558
Mithril.

1045
01:47:27.359 --> 01:47:31.728
As light as a feather.
and as hard as dragon scales.

1046
01:47:31.947 --> 01:47:35.189
Let me see you put it on. Come on.

1047
01:47:38.745 --> 01:47:40.201
Oh!

1048
01:47:43.250 --> 01:47:45.286
My old ring.

1049
01:47:46.545 --> 01:47:50.458
I should very much like...

1050
01:47:50.716 --> 01:47:54.709
To hold it again. one last time.

1051
01:48:12.070 --> 01:48:15.733
I'm sorry I brought this upon you.
my boy.

1052
01:48:16.074 --> 01:48:20.192
I'm sorry that you
must carry this burden.

1053
01:48:24.708 --> 01:48:27.745
I'm sorry for everything.

1054
01:48:42.768 --> 01:48:46.977
The ring-bearer is setting out
on the quest of mount doom.

1055
01:48:48.315 --> 01:48:50.931
On you who travel with him.
no oath

1056
01:48:51.151 --> 01:48:54.268
nor bond is laid to go further
than you will.

1057
01:48:57.741 --> 01:49:00.278
Farewell. Hold to your purpose.

1058
01:49:00.744 --> 01:49:04.657
May the blessings of elves and men...

1059
01:49:05.207 --> 01:49:07.789
And all free folk go with you.

1060
01:49:10.879 --> 01:49:14.963
The fellowship awaits the ring-bearer.

1061
01:49:33.401 --> 01:49:35.892
Mordor. Gandalf. is it left or right?

1062
01:49:36.446 --> 01:49:38.277
I eft

1063
01:50:57.777 --> 01:51:02.191
Gandalf: We must hold to this course.
west of the misty mountains. for 40 days.

1064
01:51:02.407 --> 01:51:06.150
If our luck holds. the gap of Rohan
will still be open to us.

1065
01:51:06.369 --> 01:51:09.907
From there. our road
turns east to mordor.

1066
01:51:10.081 --> 01:51:13.915
Two. one. five. Good! Very good.

1067
01:51:15.754 --> 01:51:16.789
Move your feet.

1068
01:51:17.005 --> 01:51:18.445
Merry: You look good. pippin.
Thanks.

1069
01:51:18.548 --> 01:51:19.913
Boromir: Faster!

1070
01:51:21.301 --> 01:51:25.089
If anyone was to ask for my opinion.
which I note they're not...

1071
01:51:25.305 --> 01:51:28.047
I'd say we were taking
the long way round.

1072
01:51:28.558 --> 01:51:31.595
Gandalf. we could pass through
the mines of Moria.

1073
01:51:32.270 --> 01:51:36.104
My cousin balin would give us
a royal welcome.

1074
01:51:36.441 --> 01:51:41.811
No. I would not take the road through
Moria unless I had no other choice.

1075
01:51:51.039 --> 01:51:52.119
Sorry!

1076
01:51:52.958 --> 01:51:54.448
Merry: Get him!

1077
01:51:55.794 --> 01:51:58.251
Merry: For the shire!
Pippin: Hold him. Hold him down. merry!

1078
01:51:58.797 --> 01:52:01.129
Gentlemen. that's enough.

1079
01:52:04.928 --> 01:52:06.648
Merry: You've got my arm!
You've got my arm!

1080
01:52:06.972 --> 01:52:09.634
- What is that?
- Nothing. It's just a wisp of cloud.

1081
01:52:09.891 --> 01:52:12.598
It's moving fast.

1082
01:52:12.811 --> 01:52:14.972
Against the wind.

1083
01:52:15.772 --> 01:52:17.888
Crebain from dunland! Hide!

1084
01:52:18.108 --> 01:52:20.815
- Hurry!
- Take cover!

1085
01:52:54.227 --> 01:52:55.967
Spies of saruman.

1086
01:52:56.730 --> 01:53:00.018
The passage south is being watched.

1087
01:53:01.192 --> 01:53:04.525
We must take the pass of caradhras.

1088
01:53:17.167 --> 01:53:18.873
Aragorn: Frodo!

1089
01:53:37.854 --> 01:53:40.095
Boromir.

1090
01:53:40.357 --> 01:53:44.566
It is a strange fate that we should
suffer so much fear and doubt

1091
01:53:44.778 --> 01:53:47.895
over so small a thing.

1092
01:53:51.117 --> 01:53:53.073
Such a little thing.

1093
01:53:53.286 --> 01:53:54.742
Boromir!

1094
01:53:55.372 --> 01:53:58.079
Give the ring to Frodo.

1095
01:54:07.884 --> 01:54:09.920
As you wish.

1096
01:54:10.637 --> 01:54:12.628
I care not.

1097
01:54:48.049 --> 01:54:52.759
So. Gandalf. you try
to lead them over caradhras.

1098
01:54:52.971 --> 01:54:57.556
And if that fails.
where then will you go?

1099
01:54:58.852 --> 01:55:01.810
If the mountain defeats you...

1100
01:55:02.063 --> 01:55:06.477
Will you risk
a more dangerous road?

1101
01:55:18.830 --> 01:55:21.697
There is a fell voice on the air.

1102
01:55:22.834 --> 01:55:24.324
It's saruman!

1103
01:55:33.219 --> 01:55:37.883
He's trying to bring down the mountain!
Gandalf. we must turn back!

1104
01:55:38.183 --> 01:55:39.969
No!

1105
01:56:46.417 --> 01:56:48.248
We must get off the mountain!

1106
01:56:48.753 --> 01:56:53.087
Make for the gap of Rohan.
and take the west road to my city!

1107
01:56:53.258 --> 01:56:56.591
The gap of Rohan takes us
too close to isengard!

1108
01:56:56.761 --> 01:57:00.504
Gimli: We cannot pass over a mountain.
Let us go under it.

1109
01:57:00.765 --> 01:57:03.598
Let us go through the mines of Moria.

1110
01:57:05.436 --> 01:57:09.270
Saruman: Moria. You fear to go
into those mines.

1111
01:57:09.941 --> 01:57:14.935
The dwarves delved too greedily
and too deep.

1112
01:57:15.780 --> 01:57:20.649
You know what they awoke
in the darkness of khazad-diim:

1113
01:57:21.953 --> 01:57:25.445
Shadow and flame.

1114
01:57:28.793 --> 01:57:31.455
Let the ring-bearer decide.

1115
01:57:36.175 --> 01:57:38.291
We cannot stay here!

1116
01:57:38.469 --> 01:57:41.302
This will be the death of the hobbits

1117
01:57:41.472 --> 01:57:43.178
Frodo?

1118
01:57:46.185 --> 01:57:49.052
We will go through the mines.

1119
01:57:49.814 --> 01:57:51.679
So be it.

1120
01:57:58.323 --> 01:58:02.282
Frodo. come and help an old man.

1121
01:58:05.830 --> 01:58:07.991
How is your shoulder?

1122
01:58:08.207 --> 01:58:11.495
- Better than it was.
- And the ring?

1123
01:58:13.004 --> 01:58:15.495
You feel its power growing. don't you?

1124
01:58:16.007 --> 01:58:18.919
I've felt it too.
You must be careful now.

1125
01:58:19.344 --> 01:58:23.257
Evil will be drawn to you
from outside the fellowship.

1126
01:58:23.431 --> 01:58:26.013
And. I fear. from within.

1127
01:58:28.686 --> 01:58:32.850
- Who then do I trust?
- You must trust yourself.

1128
01:58:33.024 --> 01:58:35.857
Trust your own strengths.

1129
01:58:36.027 --> 01:58:38.609
- What do you mean?
- There are many powers in this world...

1130
01:58:38.821 --> 01:58:40.857
For good or for evil.

1131
01:58:41.032 --> 01:58:43.364
Some are greater than I am.

1132
01:58:43.868 --> 01:58:47.531
And against some I have not yet
been tested

1133
01:58:48.873 --> 01:58:50.238
the walls

1134
01:58:50.958 --> 01:58:53.040
of Moria.

1135
01:58:58.758 --> 01:59:01.750
Dwarf doors are invisible when closed.

1136
01:59:01.969 --> 01:59:06.383
Gandalf: Their own masters cannot find
them if their secrets are forgotten.

1137
01:59:06.766 --> 01:59:09.257
Why doesn't that surprise me?

1138
01:59:17.276 --> 01:59:20.564
Well. let's see.

1139
01:59:20.780 --> 01:59:22.145
Ithildin.

1140
01:59:22.782 --> 01:59:26.149
It mirrors only starlight
and moonlight.

1141
01:59:40.216 --> 01:59:44.300
It reads. "the doors of Durin.
lord of Moria.

1142
01:59:44.887 --> 01:59:49.506
- Speak. friend. and enter.
- What do you suppose that means?

1143
01:59:49.767 --> 01:59:54.511
It's simple. If you are a friend. you speak
the password and the doors will open.

1144
02:00:18.296 --> 02:00:19.411
Nothing's happening.

1145
02:00:26.429 --> 02:00:30.638
I once knew every spell
in all the tongues of elves...

1146
02:00:30.975 --> 02:00:33.808
Men and orcs.

1147
02:00:34.061 --> 02:00:35.301
What are you going to do. then?

1148
02:00:35.480 --> 02:00:37.721
Knock your head against these doors.
peregrin took!

1149
02:00:37.982 --> 02:00:39.973
And if that does not shatter them _.

1150
02:00:40.151 --> 02:00:42.858
And I am allowed a little peace
from foolish questions...

1151
02:00:43.029 --> 02:00:46.487
I will try to find the opening words.

1152
02:00:59.337 --> 02:01:01.874
Mines are no place for a pony.

1153
02:01:02.089 --> 02:01:06.173
- Even one so brave as bill.
- Bye-bye. bill.

1154
02:01:07.345 --> 02:01:10.178
Go on. bill. Go on.

1155
02:01:10.681 --> 02:01:14.219
Don't worry. Sam.
he knows the way home.

1156
02:01:21.025 --> 02:01:23.607
Do not disturb the water.

1157
02:01:23.861 --> 02:01:25.692
Oh. it's useless.

1158
02:01:38.376 --> 02:01:40.537
It's a riddle.

1159
02:01:43.297 --> 02:01:46.414
"Speak 'friend' and enter."

1160
02:01:46.801 --> 02:01:49.713
What's the elvish word for "friend"?

1161
02:01:51.222 --> 02:01:52.507
Mellon

1162
02:02:10.575 --> 02:02:15.410
Gimli: Soon. master elf. you will enjoy
the fabled hospitality of the dwarves.

1163
02:02:15.913 --> 02:02:21.579
Roaring fires. malt beer.
ripe meat off the bone!

1164
02:02:23.087 --> 02:02:26.170
This. my friend.
is the home of my cousin balin.

1165
02:02:26.549 --> 02:02:28.915
And they call it a mine.

1166
02:02:29.135 --> 02:02:31.091
A mine!

1167
02:02:32.138 --> 02:02:35.471
This is no mine. It's a tomb.

1168
02:02:39.770 --> 02:02:41.180
Gimli: No.

1169
02:02:41.606 --> 02:02:43.187
No

1170
02:02:44.442 --> 02:02:46.103
No!

1171
02:02:48.779 --> 02:02:50.269
(Goblins.

1172
02:02:54.201 --> 02:02:58.490
We make for the gap of Rohan.
We should never have come here.

1173
02:02:59.582 --> 02:03:02.119
Aragorn:
Now. get out of here. Get out!

1174
02:03:04.962 --> 02:03:07.294
Merry: Frodo! Frodo: Help!

1175
02:03:07.506 --> 02:03:09.121
Strider!

1176
02:03:09.300 --> 02:03:12.133
Frodo: Help! Sam: Get off him!

1177
02:03:12.303 --> 02:03:13.303
Aragorn!

1178
02:03:23.731 --> 02:03:24.811
Frodo!

1179
02:03:25.983 --> 02:03:27.519
Strider!

1180
02:03:51.133 --> 02:03:52.168
Into the mines!

1181
02:03:52.343 --> 02:03:55.551
- Legolas!
Aragorn: Into the cave!

1182
02:03:59.850 --> 02:04:01.636
Run!

1183
02:04:18.536 --> 02:04:22.074
Gandalf:
We now have but one choice.

1184
02:04:22.289 --> 02:04:27.204
We must face the long dark of Moria.

1185
02:04:27.420 --> 02:04:29.376
Be on your guard.

1186
02:04:29.588 --> 02:04:33.046
There are older
and fouler things than orcs...

1187
02:04:33.217 --> 02:04:36.755
In the deep places of the world.

1188
02:04:44.729 --> 02:04:48.688
Quietly now. It's a four-day journey
to the other side.

1189
02:04:48.899 --> 02:04:52.733
Let us hope that our presence
may go unnoticed.

1190
02:05:38.491 --> 02:05:42.200
The wealth of Moria is not in gold...

1191
02:05:42.369 --> 02:05:44.781
Or jewels...

1192
02:05:44.955 --> 02:05:47.992
But mithril.

1193
02:06:06.352 --> 02:06:11.267
Bilbo had a shirt of mithril rings
that Thorin gave him.

1194
02:06:11.482 --> 02:06:15.475
Oh. that was a kingly gift. Yes

1195
02:06:15.653 --> 02:06:17.518
I never told him_..

1196
02:06:17.696 --> 02:06:22.656
But its worth was greater than
the value of the shire.

1197
02:06:35.005 --> 02:06:36.711
Pippin.

1198
02:06:57.403 --> 02:07:00.019
I have no memory of this place.

1199
02:07:02.116 --> 02:07:03.606
Pippin: Are we lost? Merry: No.

1200
02:07:03.826 --> 02:07:06.317
Pippin: I think we are.
Merry: Gandalf's thinking.

1201
02:07:06.537 --> 02:07:07.947
Pippin: Merry? Merry: What?

1202
02:07:08.247 --> 02:07:10.203
Pippin: I'm hungry.

1203
02:07:21.510 --> 02:07:25.970
There's something down there.
It's gollum.

1204
02:07:26.182 --> 02:07:30.300
- Gollum?
- He's been following us for three days.

1205
02:07:30.519 --> 02:07:34.683
- He escaped the dungeons of barad-dur?
- Escaped...

1206
02:07:35.357 --> 02:07:37.018
Or was set loose.

1207
02:07:37.526 --> 02:07:41.189
Now the ring has brought him here.

1208
02:07:43.824 --> 02:07:46.566
He will never be rid of his need for it.

1209
02:07:46.744 --> 02:07:52.489
He hates and loves the ring.
a8 he hates and loves himself

1210
02:07:52.666 --> 02:07:57.535
smeagol's life is a sad story.

1211
02:07:57.713 --> 02:08:03.674
Yes. smeagol he was once called.
Before the ring found him.

1212
02:08:04.595 --> 02:08:07.382
Before it drove him mad.

1213
02:08:07.681 --> 02:08:10.548
It's a pity bilbo didn't kill him
when he had the chance

1214
02:08:10.726 --> 02:08:11.932
pity?

1215
02:08:13.020 --> 02:08:15.887
It is pity that stayed bilbo's hand.

1216
02:08:16.815 --> 02:08:22.026
Many that live deserve death.
Some that die deserve life

1217
02:08:23.447 --> 02:08:25.938
can you give it to them. Frodo?

1218
02:08:28.369 --> 02:08:32.328
Do not be too eager
to deal out death and judgment.

1219
02:08:32.539 --> 02:08:35.451
Even the very wise
cannot see all ends.

1220
02:08:36.043 --> 02:08:41.959
My heart tells me that gollum has some
part to play yet. for good or ill...

1221
02:08:42.758 --> 02:08:45.591
Before this is over.

1222
02:08:47.096 --> 02:08:50.964
The pity of bilbo
may rule the fate of many.

1223
02:08:57.606 --> 02:09:00.973
I wish the ring
had never come to me.

1224
02:09:02.403 --> 02:09:04.439
I wish none of this had happened.

1225
02:09:04.613 --> 02:09:09.653
So do all who live to see such times.
But that is not for them to decide

1226
02:09:10.494 --> 02:09:15.989
all we have to decide is what to do
with the time that is given to us.

1227
02:09:17.501 --> 02:09:21.494
There are other forces at work in this
world. Frodo. besides the will of evil.

1228
02:09:21.880 --> 02:09:24.292
Bilbo was meant to find the ring.

1229
02:09:24.800 --> 02:09:29.134
In which case.
you also were meant to have it.

1230
02:09:29.305 --> 02:09:32.513
And that is an encouraging thought.

1231
02:09:35.436 --> 02:09:36.596
Ah!

1232
02:09:37.396 --> 02:09:39.307
It's that way.

1233
02:09:39.523 --> 02:09:41.809
He's remembered. Gandalf: No.

1234
02:09:42.026 --> 02:09:45.814
But the air doesn't smell
so foul down here.

1235
02:09:46.030 --> 02:09:51.195
If in doubt. meriadoc.
always follow your nose.

1236
02:10:06.050 --> 02:10:10.168
Let me risk a little more light.

1237
02:10:14.850 --> 02:10:16.932
Behold

1238
02:10:17.353 --> 02:10:22.564
the great realm
and dwarf-city of dwarrowdelf.

1239
02:10:25.069 --> 02:10:28.482
There's an eye opener. and no mistake.

1240
02:10:53.389 --> 02:10:55.095
Gimli!

1241
02:11:00.896 --> 02:11:02.352
No

1242
02:11:02.564 --> 02:11:04.179
No!

1243
02:11:06.735 --> 02:11:09.898
Oh. no.

1244
02:11:11.740 --> 02:11:13.025
No

1245
02:11:20.290 --> 02:11:22.281
Gandalf: "Here lies balin

1246
02:11:22.751 --> 02:11:24.742
son of fundin__.

1247
02:11:25.087 --> 02:11:27.703
Lord of Moria."

1248
02:11:28.757 --> 02:11:30.418
He is dead. then.

1249
02:11:32.594 --> 02:11:33.800
It's as I feared.

1250
02:11:52.114 --> 02:11:55.026
We must move on. We cannot linger.

1251
02:11:55.242 --> 02:11:59.952
Gandalf: "They have taken the bridge
and the second hall

1252
02:12:01.039 --> 02:12:03.621
we have barred the gates...

1253
02:12:04.293 --> 02:12:06.784
But cannot hold them for long.

1254
02:12:06.962 --> 02:12:09.795
The ground shakes.

1255
02:12:10.174 --> 02:12:11.789
Drums.

1256
02:12:12.176 --> 02:12:15.543
Drums in the deep.

1257
02:12:19.099 --> 02:12:21.135
We cannot get out.

1258
02:12:23.145 --> 02:12:26.979
A shadow moves in the dark.

1259
02:12:28.650 --> 02:12:31.187
We cannot get out.

1260
02:12:34.198 --> 02:12:36.154
They are coming."

1261
02:13:19.201 --> 02:13:21.032
Fool of a took!

1262
02:13:21.370 --> 02:13:25.204
Throw yourself in next time.
and rid us of your stupidity.

1263
02:13:51.149 --> 02:13:52.764
Sam: Frodo!

1264
02:13:55.070 --> 02:13:56.560
Orcs.

1265
02:14:03.620 --> 02:14:05.611
Get back! Stay close to Gandalf!

1266
02:14:12.879 --> 02:14:14.665
They have a cave-troll.

1267
02:14:30.480 --> 02:14:31.640
I et them come!

1268
02:14:32.149 --> 02:14:35.687
There is one dwarf yet in Moria
who still draws breath

1269
02:16:54.583 --> 02:16:57.325
I think I'm getting the hang of this.

1270
02:17:02.090 --> 02:17:03.751
Frodo!

1271
02:17:37.292 --> 02:17:39.123
Frodo: Aragorn! Aragorn!

1272
02:17:40.128 --> 02:17:41.993
Frodo!

1273
02:18:27.175 --> 02:18:29.040
Frodo!

1274
02:18:31.847 --> 02:18:33.303
Frodo!

1275
02:19:29.279 --> 02:19:30.610
Oh. no.

1276
02:19:38.997 --> 02:19:40.862
He's alive.

1277
02:19:43.293 --> 02:19:46.285
I'm all right. I'm not hurt.

1278
02:19:46.630 --> 02:19:48.791
You should be dead.

1279
02:19:49.007 --> 02:19:51.498
That spear would have skewered
a wild boar.

1280
02:19:51.760 --> 02:19:56.504
I think there's more to this hobbit
than meets the eye.

1281
02:20:02.312 --> 02:20:03.427
Mithril.

1282
02:20:06.232 --> 02:20:08.814
You are full of surprises.
master Baggins.

1283
02:20:14.824 --> 02:20:16.780
To the bridge of khazad-dum!

1284
02:20:31.758 --> 02:20:33.339
Aragorn: This way!

1285
02:21:43.747 --> 02:21:46.739
What is this new devilry?

1286
02:22:02.849 --> 02:22:05.636
A balrog.

1287
02:22:05.935 --> 02:22:09.098
A demon of the ancient world.

1288
02:22:11.274 --> 02:22:13.731
This foe is beyond any of you.

1289
02:22:14.903 --> 02:22:16.439
Run!

1290
02:22:23.787 --> 02:22:25.277
Quickly!

1291
02:22:41.930 --> 02:22:43.170
(Sandalf.

1292
02:22:43.807 --> 02:22:45.422
Lead them on. aragorn.

1293
02:22:46.810 --> 02:22:49.301
The bridge is near.

1294
02:22:51.397 --> 02:22:55.481
Do as I say!
Swords are no more use here.

1295
02:23:24.639 --> 02:23:26.345
(Gandalf!

1296
02:23:44.659 --> 02:23:45.865
Boromir: Merry! Pippin!

1297
02:23:57.005 --> 02:23:58.541
Sam!

1298
02:24:01.259 --> 02:24:04.501
Nobody tosses a dwarf.

1299
02:24:07.557 --> 02:24:08.967
Not the beard!

1300
02:24:22.197 --> 02:24:24.062
Steady.

1301
02:24:26.201 --> 02:24:27.862
Hold on!

1302
02:24:48.932 --> 02:24:50.092
Hang on!

1303
02:25:00.902 --> 02:25:02.608
I Ean forward!

1304
02:25:05.615 --> 02:25:06.615
Steady.

1305
02:25:07.951 --> 02:25:09.111
Come on!

1306
02:25:09.369 --> 02:25:10.859
Now!

1307
02:25:28.096 --> 02:25:29.882
Over the bridge!

1308
02:25:30.139 --> 02:25:31.629
Fly!

1309
02:26:16.352 --> 02:26:18.343
You cannot pass!

1310
02:26:18.521 --> 02:26:20.182
(Gandalf!

1311
02:26:24.402 --> 02:26:29.271
I am a servant of the secret fire.
wielder of the flame of anor.

1312
02:26:30.283 --> 02:26:34.026
The dark fire will not avail you.
flame of ud[N!

1313
02:26:44.047 --> 02:26:46.038
(So back to the shadow.

1314
02:26:53.890 --> 02:26:58.304
You shall not pass!

1315
02:27:25.463 --> 02:27:29.331
Boromir: No! No! - Gandalf!

1316
02:27:37.016 --> 02:27:39.473
Fly. you fools!

1317
02:27:43.606 --> 02:27:45.767
No!

1318
02:27:51.948 --> 02:27:54.109
Aragorn!

1319
02:28:51.340 --> 02:28:54.173
Legolas. get them up.

1320
02:28:58.306 --> 02:29:00.137
Give them a moment. for pity's sake!

1321
02:29:00.308 --> 02:29:03.926
By nightfall. these hills will
be swarming with orcs.

1322
02:29:04.145 --> 02:29:07.478
We must reach the woods of I othlorien.

1323
02:29:08.357 --> 02:29:11.690
Come. Boromir. Legolas.
Gimli. get them up.

1324
02:29:13.196 --> 02:29:15.357
On your feet. Sam.

1325
02:29:15.698 --> 02:29:17.188
Frodo?

1326
02:29:19.285 --> 02:29:20.991
Frodo!

1327
02:30:13.506 --> 02:30:16.043
Stay close. young hobbits!

1328
02:30:16.759 --> 02:30:20.923
They say that a great sorceress
lives in these woods.

1329
02:30:21.138 --> 02:30:23.675
An elf-witch

1330
02:30:24.225 --> 02:30:27.092
of terrible power.

1331
02:30:27.645 --> 02:30:29.852
All who look upon her...

1332
02:30:30.064 --> 02:30:31.850
Fall under her spell.

1333
02:30:32.066 --> 02:30:33.351
Female voice: Frodo!

1334
02:30:35.611 --> 02:30:37.647
And are never seen again.

1335
02:30:37.863 --> 02:30:42.357
Female voice: Your coming to us is
as the footsteps of doom.

1336
02:30:42.577 --> 02:30:46.286
You bring great evil here.
ring-beatrer.

1337
02:30:46.455 --> 02:30:48.241
Sam: Mr Frodo?

1338
02:30:53.546 --> 02:30:59.132
Well. here's one dwarf
she won't ensnare so easily.

1339
02:30:59.302 --> 02:31:03.887
I have the eyes of a hawk
and the ears of a fox.

1340
02:31:11.564 --> 02:31:16.149
The dwarf breathes so loud.
we could have shot him in the dark.

1341
02:31:34.295 --> 02:31:36.581
So much for the legendary courtesy
of the elves!

1342
02:31:36.756 --> 02:31:38.667
Speak words we can all understand!

1343
02:31:38.841 --> 02:31:43.426
We have not had dealings
with the dwarves since the dark days.

1344
02:31:43.679 --> 02:31:46.216
And you know what this dwarf
says to that?

1345
02:31:53.147 --> 02:31:55.103
That was not so courteous.

1346
02:32:01.656 --> 02:32:05.695
You bring great evil with you.

1347
02:32:07.453 --> 02:32:09.660
You can go no further.

1348
02:32:46.909 --> 02:32:49.571
(Gandalf's death was not in vain.

1349
02:32:50.705 --> 02:32:52.570
Nor would he have you give up hope.

1350
02:32:54.083 --> 02:32:57.416
You carry a heavy burden. Frodo.

1351
02:32:58.295 --> 02:33:01.412
Don't carry the weight of the dead.

1352
02:33:04.385 --> 02:33:06.421
You will follow me.

1353
02:33:18.107 --> 02:33:20.098
Caras galadhon.

1354
02:33:20.735 --> 02:33:23.693
The heart of elvendom on earth.

1355
02:33:23.863 --> 02:33:29.529
Realm of the lord celeborn
and of Galadriel. lady of light.

1356
02:34:48.531 --> 02:34:51.648
The enemy knows you have entered here.

1357
02:34:52.326 --> 02:34:57.491
What hope you had in secrecy
is now gone.

1358
02:34:59.208 --> 02:35:03.668
Eight there are here. yet nine there
were set out from rivendell

1359
02:35:03.921 --> 02:35:05.707
tell me. where is Gandalf?

1360
02:35:05.923 --> 02:35:09.040
For I much desire to speak with him.

1361
02:35:09.218 --> 02:35:12.005
I can no longer see him from afar.

1362
02:35:12.888 --> 02:35:18.053
Galadriel: Gandalf the grey did not
pass the borders of this land.

1363
02:35:18.310 --> 02:35:20.722
He has fallen into shadow.

1364
02:35:25.442 --> 02:35:29.936
He was taken by both shadow and flame.

1365
02:35:31.574 --> 02:35:35.317
A balrog of morgoth.

1366
02:35:36.036 --> 02:35:39.403
For we went needlessly
into the net of Moria.

1367
02:35:41.542 --> 02:35:44.750
Needless were none of the deeds
of Gandalf in life.

1368
02:35:45.421 --> 02:35:48.709
We do not yet know his full purpose.

1369
02:35:53.470 --> 02:35:57.759
Do not let the great emptiness
of khazad-dam fill your heart...

1370
02:35:58.058 --> 02:36:00.390
Gimli. son of gloin.

1371
02:36:01.395 --> 02:36:04.933
For the world has grown
full of peril...

1372
02:36:06.400 --> 02:36:09.062
And in all lands

1373
02:36:09.236 --> 02:36:12.728
love is now mingled with grief.

1374
02:36:25.377 --> 02:36:28.084
What now becomes of this fellowship?

1375
02:36:28.631 --> 02:36:31.623
Without Gandalf. hope is lost.

1376
02:36:34.595 --> 02:36:37.883
The quest stands upon the edge
of a knife.

1377
02:36:38.057 --> 02:36:41.140
Stray but a little and it will fall...

1378
02:36:41.894 --> 02:36:44.727
To the ruin of all

1379
02:36:49.068 --> 02:36:54.904
yet hope remains
while the company is true.

1380
02:36:56.450 --> 02:37:01.160
Do not let your hearts be troubled.
Go now and rest

1381
02:37:01.622 --> 02:37:05.285
for you are weary with sorrow
and much toil

1382
02:37:07.544 --> 02:37:09.660
tonight. you will sleep...

1383
02:37:09.838 --> 02:37:13.251
Galadriel:
Welcome. Frodo of the shire...

1384
02:37:14.843 --> 02:37:16.629
One who has seen the eye!

1385
02:37:31.276 --> 02:37:33.858
A lament for Gandalf

1386
02:37:41.120 --> 02:37:42.656
What do they say about him?

1387
02:37:42.871 --> 02:37:45.533
I have not the heart to tell you.

1388
02:37:48.293 --> 02:37:50.534
For me. the grief is still too near.

1389
02:37:53.507 --> 02:37:56.340
I bet they don't mention his fireworks.

1390
02:37:56.510 --> 02:37:59.547
There should be a verse about them.

1391
02:38:03.100 --> 02:38:05.091
The finest rockets ever seen

1392
02:38:06.228 --> 02:38:09.061
they burst in stars of blue and green

1393
02:38:09.982 --> 02:38:13.395
or after thunder. silver showers

1394
02:38:15.904 --> 02:38:18.691
came falling like a rain of flowers

1395
02:38:18.866 --> 02:38:22.734
oh. that doesn't do them justice
by a long road.

1396
02:38:33.589 --> 02:38:36.251
Aragorn: Take some rest.

1397
02:38:36.425 --> 02:38:39.132
These borders are well-protected.

1398
02:38:39.344 --> 02:38:41.881
I will find no rest here.

1399
02:38:44.725 --> 02:38:47.717
I heard her voice inside my head.

1400
02:38:47.936 --> 02:38:51.679
She spoke of my father
and the fall of gondor.

1401
02:38:51.899 --> 02:38:57.360
She said to me.
"even now there is hope left."

1402
02:38:58.739 --> 02:39:01.572
But I cannot see it.

1403
02:39:02.910 --> 02:39:05.401
It is long since we had any hope.

1404
02:39:15.589 --> 02:39:17.705
My father is a noble man.

1405
02:39:18.467 --> 02:39:20.708
But his rule is failing...

1406
02:39:21.053 --> 02:39:26.468
And our people lose faith.

1407
02:39:27.893 --> 02:39:31.431
He looks to me to make things right.
and I would do it.

1408
02:39:31.605 --> 02:39:35.143
I would see the glory
of gondor restored

1409
02:39:37.986 --> 02:39:40.978
have you ever seen it. aragorn?

1410
02:39:41.615 --> 02:39:43.651
The white tower of ecthelion.

1411
02:39:43.826 --> 02:39:47.660
Glimmering like a spike
of Pearl and silver.

1412
02:39:48.330 --> 02:39:51.822
Its banners caught high
in the morning breeze.

1413
02:39:54.711 --> 02:39:56.667
Have you ever been called home...

1414
02:39:56.839 --> 02:40:00.798
By the clear ringing
of silver trumpets?

1415
02:40:01.426 --> 02:40:04.668
I have seen the white city...

1416
02:40:05.013 --> 02:40:06.503
Long ago.

1417
02:40:07.474 --> 02:40:12.434
One day. our paths will lead us there.

1418
02:40:13.355 --> 02:40:16.313
And the tower guard
shall take up the call:

1419
02:40:16.775 --> 02:40:20.108
"The lords of gondor have returned

1420
02:41:27.304 --> 02:41:29.841
Will you look into the mirror?

1421
02:41:30.015 --> 02:41:31.551
What will I see?

1422
02:41:34.519 --> 02:41:36.851
Fven the wisest cannot tell

1423
02:41:37.773 --> 02:41:39.604
for the mirror...

1424
02:41:39.816 --> 02:41:42.353
Shows many things.

1425
02:41:45.364 --> 02:41:47.730
Things that were...

1426
02:41:47.950 --> 02:41:50.532
Things that are...

1427
02:41:51.286 --> 02:41:53.242
And some things...

1428
02:41:56.833 --> 02:42:00.121
That have not yet come to pass.

1429
02:43:22.711 --> 02:43:25.544
I know what it is you saw.

1430
02:43:27.966 --> 02:43:30.457
For it is also in my mind.

1431
02:43:32.220 --> 02:43:36.304
It is what will come to pass
if you should fail.

1432
02:43:38.685 --> 02:43:43.554
The fellowship is breaking.
It is already begun.

1433
02:43:44.191 --> 02:43:47.479
He will try to take the ring.

1434
02:43:47.694 --> 02:43:49.685
You know of whom I speak.

1435
02:43:50.697 --> 02:43:55.361
One by one. it will destroy them all.

1436
02:43:56.870 --> 02:43:59.327
Frodo: If you ask it of me...

1437
02:43:59.706 --> 02:44:02.743
I will give you the one ring.

1438
02:44:03.835 --> 02:44:05.996
You offer it to me freely.

1439
02:44:10.592 --> 02:44:14.505
I do not deny that my heart
has greatly desired this.

1440
02:44:20.894 --> 02:44:24.182
In place of a dark lord.
you would have a queen...

1441
02:44:24.606 --> 02:44:28.440
Not dark but beautiful.
and terrible as the dawn!

1442
02:44:29.069 --> 02:44:32.106
Treacherous as the seal

1443
02:44:32.614 --> 02:44:37.529
stronger than the foundations
of the earth!

1444
02:44:37.994 --> 02:44:40.360
All shall love me

1445
02:44:40.580 --> 02:44:43.413
and despair.

1446
02:44:57.514 --> 02:45:01.803
I pass the test. I will diminish...

1447
02:45:02.102 --> 02:45:04.559
And go into the west...

1448
02:45:04.771 --> 02:45:09.231
- And remain Galadriel.
- I cannot do this alone.

1449
02:45:12.821 --> 02:45:16.985
You are a ring-bearer. Frodo.
To bear a ring of power...

1450
02:45:17.909 --> 02:45:19.399
Is to be alone.

1451
02:45:22.747 --> 02:45:25.489
This is nenya.
the ring of adamant.

1452
02:45:25.667 --> 02:45:27.282
And I am its keeper.

1453
02:45:30.505 --> 02:45:34.123
This task was appointed to you.

1454
02:45:35.177 --> 02:45:38.044
And if you do not find a way...

1455
02:45:39.264 --> 02:45:41.255
No one will

1456
02:45:41.641 --> 02:45:44.804
then I know what I must do

1457
02:45:45.479 --> 02:45:46.685
it's just...

1458
02:45:49.941 --> 02:45:52.182
I'm afraid to do it.

1459
02:45:55.697 --> 02:46:00.817
Even the smallest person can change
the course of the future.

1460
02:46:06.166 --> 02:46:11.877
Do you know how the orcs
first came into being?

1461
02:46:12.672 --> 02:46:16.005
They were elves once.

1462
02:46:17.177 --> 02:46:20.510
Taken by the dark powers...

1463
02:46:20.722 --> 02:46:23.885
Tortured and mutilated.

1464
02:46:24.226 --> 02:46:29.516
A ruined and terrible form of life.

1465
02:46:29.814 --> 02:46:31.645
And now

1466
02:46:33.109 --> 02:46:34.974
perfected.

1467
02:46:35.695 --> 02:46:38.858
My fighting uruk-hai...

1468
02:46:40.825 --> 02:46:43.157
Whom do you serve?

1469
02:46:43.370 --> 02:46:45.861
Saruman!

1470
02:47:06.726 --> 02:47:10.184
Hunt them down. Do not stop
until they are found.

1471
02:47:10.397 --> 02:47:13.264
You do not know pain.
You do not know fear.

1472
02:47:13.525 --> 02:47:16.437
You will taste man-flesh!

1473
02:47:21.533 --> 02:47:25.242
One of the halflings carries
something of great value.

1474
02:47:25.412 --> 02:47:29.576
Bring them to me alive and unspoiled.

1475
02:47:31.418 --> 02:47:32.703
Kill the others.

1476
02:47:51.896 --> 02:47:57.311
Celeborn: Never before have we clad
strangers in the garb of our own people.

1477
02:47:58.445 --> 02:48:02.279
May these cloaks help shield you
from unfriendly eyes.

1478
02:48:09.456 --> 02:48:10.992
I embas.

1479
02:48:11.249 --> 02:48:12.830
Elvish waybread.

1480
02:48:15.337 --> 02:48:18.329
One small bite is enough to fill
the stomach of a grown man.

1481
02:48:24.846 --> 02:48:26.802
How many did you eat?

1482
02:48:26.973 --> 02:48:28.634
Four.

1483
02:48:34.439 --> 02:48:37.039
Celeborn: Every league you travel south.
the danger will increase.

1484
02:48:37.233 --> 02:48:41.351
Mordor orcs now hold the eastern shore
of the anduin.

1485
02:48:41.529 --> 02:48:44.020
Nor will you find safety
oh the western bank.

1486
02:48:44.240 --> 02:48:48.028
Strange creatures bearing the white hand
have been seen on our borders.

1487
02:48:48.244 --> 02:48:53.329
Seldom do orcs journey in the open
under the sun. yet these have done so.

1488
02:49:05.929 --> 02:49:07.406
By river you have the chance...

1489
02:49:07.430 --> 02:49:10.638
Of outrunning the enemy
to the falls of rauros.

1490
02:49:27.909 --> 02:49:32.744
Galadriel: My gift for you. Legolas.
is a bow of the galadhrim.

1491
02:49:32.997 --> 02:49:36.489
Worthy of the skill
of our woodland kin.

1492
02:49:41.881 --> 02:49:44.338
These are the daggers of the noldorin.

1493
02:49:44.509 --> 02:49:48.502
They have already seen service in war.

1494
02:49:48.680 --> 02:49:50.921
Do not fear. young peregrin took.

1495
02:49:51.099 --> 02:49:54.432
You will find your courage.

1496
02:49:56.312 --> 02:49:58.268
And for you. samwise gamgee...

1497
02:49:58.440 --> 02:50:01.022
Elven rope made of hithlain.

1498
02:50:01.192 --> 02:50:03.308
Thank you. my lady.

1499
02:50:05.113 --> 02:50:08.446
Have you run out
of those nice. shiny daggers?

1500
02:50:14.914 --> 02:50:17.951
And what gift would a dwarf ask
of the elves?

1501
02:50:18.126 --> 02:50:20.242
Nothing.

1502
02:50:20.879 --> 02:50:24.212
Except to look upon the lady
of the galadhrim one last time

1503
02:50:24.841 --> 02:50:30.052
for she is more fair
than all the jewels beneath the earth.

1504
02:50:37.103 --> 02:50:38.639
Actually...

1505
02:50:38.855 --> 02:50:40.470
There was one thing.

1506
02:50:41.316 --> 02:50:43.978
No. no. I'm talking nonsense.
It's quite impossible.

1507
02:50:44.152 --> 02:50:46.939
Stupid to ask.

1508
02:50:49.491 --> 02:50:51.607
Galadriel:
I have nothing greater to give...

1509
02:50:51.785 --> 02:50:55.369
Than the gift you already bear.

1510
02:51:21.022 --> 02:51:24.105
That choice is yet before her.

1511
02:51:24.692 --> 02:51:27.604
You have your own choice to make.
aragorn.

1512
02:51:27.946 --> 02:51:33.782
To rise above the height of all
your fathers since the days of elendil...

1513
02:51:33.952 --> 02:51:38.286
Or to fall into darkness
with all that is left of your kin.

1514
02:52:05.859 --> 02:52:09.067
Farewell. Frodo Baggins.

1515
02:52:09.237 --> 02:52:12.650
I give you the light of earendil...

1516
02:52:13.408 --> 02:52:15.740
Our most beloved star.

1517
02:52:24.878 --> 02:52:29.247
May it be a light for you
in dark places...

1518
02:52:29.507 --> 02:52:33.591
When all other lights go out.

1519
02:52:42.437 --> 02:52:45.600
Gimli: I have taken my worst wound
at this parting...

1520
02:52:46.232 --> 02:52:50.521
Naving looked my last upon that
which is fairest

1521
02:52:51.279 --> 02:52:54.612
henceforth I will call nothing fair
unless it be her gift to me.

1522
02:52:54.866 --> 02:52:56.777
What was her gift?

1523
02:52:56.993 --> 02:53:01.908
I asked her for one hair
from her golden head.

1524
02:53:02.707 --> 02:53:05.574
She gave me three.

1525
02:54:47.729 --> 02:54:51.187
Gollum. He has tracked us since Moria.

1526
02:54:54.902 --> 02:54:58.019
I had hoped we would lose him
on the river.

1527
02:54:58.239 --> 02:55:01.402
But he's too clever a waterman.

1528
02:55:02.243 --> 02:55:05.576
And if he alerts the enemy
to our whereabouts

1529
02:55:05.747 --> 02:55:07.988
it will make the crossing
even more dangerous.

1530
02:55:08.166 --> 02:55:10.248
Sam: Have some food. Mr. Frodo.

1531
02:55:10.418 --> 02:55:13.501
- No. Sam.
- You haven't eaten anything all day.

1532
02:55:13.671 --> 02:55:16.754
You're not sleeping. neither.
Don't think I haven't noticed.

1533
02:55:17.717 --> 02:55:20.709
- Mr. Frodo...
- I'm all right.

1534
02:55:20.887 --> 02:55:22.047
But you're not.

1535
02:55:22.346 --> 02:55:24.837
I'm here to help you.

1536
02:55:25.016 --> 02:55:26.722
I promised Gandalf that I would.

1537
02:55:32.690 --> 02:55:35.432
You can't help me. Sam.

1538
02:55:37.570 --> 02:55:39.276
Not this time.

1539
02:55:42.200 --> 02:55:44.282
Get some sleep.

1540
02:55:50.541 --> 02:55:52.748
Minas tirith is the safer road.

1541
02:55:53.294 --> 02:55:56.036
You know that.
From there we can regroup.

1542
02:55:56.714 --> 02:55:58.955
Strike out for mordor from a place
of strength.

1543
02:55:59.300 --> 02:56:02.167
There is no strength in gondor
that can avail us.

1544
02:56:02.637 --> 02:56:04.628
You were quick enough to trust
the elves.

1545
02:56:06.474 --> 02:56:09.307
Have you so little faith
in your own people?

1546
02:56:09.477 --> 02:56:12.469
Yes. there is weakness.
There is frailty.

1547
02:56:12.688 --> 02:56:15.976
But there is courage also.
and honor to be found in men.

1548
02:56:16.234 --> 02:56:18.441
But you will not see that.

1549
02:56:18.778 --> 02:56:20.188
You are afraid!

1550
02:56:20.446 --> 02:56:22.983
All your life. you have hidden
in the shadows

1551
02:56:23.282 --> 02:56:26.740
scared of who you are.
of what you are.

1552
02:56:29.163 --> 02:56:33.497
I will not lead the ring within
a hundred leagues of your city.

1553
02:56:45.346 --> 02:56:46.711
Frodo.

1554
02:56:48.599 --> 02:56:50.089
The argonath.

1555
02:56:53.521 --> 02:56:57.264
Long have I desired
to look upon the kings of old.

1556
02:56:58.025 --> 02:56:59.936
My kin.

1557
02:58:18.940 --> 02:58:21.101
We cross the lake at nightfall.

1558
02:58:21.359 --> 02:58:23.941
Hide the boats and continue on foot.

1559
02:58:24.111 --> 02:58:27.603
- We approach mordor from the north.
- Oh. yes?

1560
02:58:28.032 --> 02:58:31.866
Just a simple matter of finding
our way through emyn mull...

1561
02:58:32.036 --> 02:58:35.278
An impassable labyrinth
of razor-sharp rocks.

1562
02:58:35.456 --> 02:58:38.573
And after that. it gets even better.

1563
02:58:38.960 --> 02:58:43.920
Festering. stinking marshland
as far as the eye can see.

1564
02:58:44.090 --> 02:58:45.455
That is our road.

1565
02:58:47.051 --> 02:58:50.259
I suggest you take some rest
and recover your strength. master dwarf.

1566
02:58:50.471 --> 02:58:52.211
Recover my...

1567
02:58:55.226 --> 02:58:57.217
We should leave now. No.

1568
02:58:57.395 --> 02:59:01.855
Orcs patrol the eastern shore.
We must wait for cover of darkness.

1569
02:59:02.066 --> 02:59:05.479
It is not the eastern shore
that worries me.

1570
02:59:05.736 --> 02:59:09.729
A shadow and a threat
has been growing in my mind.

1571
02:59:10.241 --> 02:59:14.405
Something draws near.
I can feel it.

1572
02:59:16.414 --> 02:59:21.374
Recover strength?
Pay no heed to that. young hobbit.

1573
02:59:21.877 --> 02:59:23.583
Where's Frodo?

1574
02:59:49.196 --> 02:59:51.107
Boromir:
None of us should wander alone.

1575
02:59:52.533 --> 02:59:54.615
You. least of all.

1576
02:59:54.827 --> 02:59:57.284
So much depends on you.

1577
02:59:58.331 --> 03:00:00.287
Frodo?

1578
03:00:07.423 --> 03:00:09.960
I know why you seek solitude.

1579
03:00:10.676 --> 03:00:14.134
You suffer. I see it day by day.

1580
03:00:14.930 --> 03:00:17.967
You sure you do not suffer needlessly?

1581
03:00:19.560 --> 03:00:22.176
There are other ways. Frodo.

1582
03:00:22.438 --> 03:00:26.226
- Other paths that we might take.
- I know what you would say.

1583
03:00:26.484 --> 03:00:30.227
It would seem like wisdom
but for the warning in my heart.

1584
03:00:30.488 --> 03:00:33.571
Warning? Against what?

1585
03:00:33.741 --> 03:00:35.857
We're all afraid. Frodo.

1586
03:00:36.077 --> 03:00:39.695
But to let that fear drive us.
to destroy what hope we have...

1587
03:00:39.955 --> 03:00:43.698
- Don't you see that is madness?
- There is no other way.

1588
03:00:45.503 --> 03:00:48.836
I ask only for the strength
to defend my people!

1589
03:00:50.383 --> 03:00:52.465
- If you would but lend me the ring.
- No.

1590
03:00:53.677 --> 03:00:57.340
- Why do you recoil? I am no thief.
- You are not yourself.

1591
03:00:59.183 --> 03:01:02.516
What chance do you think you have?

1592
03:01:02.686 --> 03:01:07.350
They will find you.
They will take the ring.

1593
03:01:07.608 --> 03:01:11.271
And you will beg for death
before the end!

1594
03:01:13.406 --> 03:01:15.522
You fool!

1595
03:01:15.699 --> 03:01:19.692
It is not yours. save by unhappy chance!
It could have been mine.

1596
03:01:19.870 --> 03:01:22.703
It should be mine! Give it to me!

1597
03:01:22.873 --> 03:01:24.204
- Give it to me!
- No!

1598
03:01:24.375 --> 03:01:26.206
- Give it to me!
- No.

1599
03:01:33.884 --> 03:01:35.875
I see your mind.

1600
03:01:36.137 --> 03:01:39.049
You will take the ring to Sauron!

1601
03:01:39.265 --> 03:01:41.130
You will betray us!

1602
03:01:41.392 --> 03:01:44.555
You'll go to your death.
and the death of us alll

1603
03:01:45.020 --> 03:01:48.638
curse you!
Curse you and all the halflings!

1604
03:01:55.739 --> 03:01:57.229
Frodo?

1605
03:02:01.579 --> 03:02:03.160
Frodo.

1606
03:02:07.084 --> 03:02:09.075
What have I done?

1607
03:02:09.295 --> 03:02:11.035
Please. Frodo.

1608
03:02:11.255 --> 03:02:13.917
Frodo. I'm sorry!

1609
03:02:14.133 --> 03:02:15.998
Frodo!

1610
03:03:02.473 --> 03:03:03.883
Frodo?

1611
03:03:05.142 --> 03:03:08.225
- It has taken Boromir.
- Where is the ring?

1612
03:03:08.479 --> 03:03:10.219
Stay away!

1613
03:03:10.648 --> 03:03:12.229
Frodo!

1614
03:03:14.485 --> 03:03:18.319
- I swore to protect you.
- Can you protect me from yourself?

1615
03:03:27.998 --> 03:03:30.489
Would you destroy it?

1616
03:03:35.506 --> 03:03:37.417
Voice of the ring: Aragorn.

1617
03:03:40.844 --> 03:03:43.176
Aragorn.

1618
03:03:45.015 --> 03:03:46.846
Flessar

1619
03:03:54.525 --> 03:03:57.858
I would have gone with you to the end.

1620
03:03:58.529 --> 03:04:01.362
Into the very fires of mordor.

1621
03:04:04.702 --> 03:04:05.862
I know.

1622
03:04:08.372 --> 03:04:13.787
Look after the others. Especially Sam.
He will not understand.

1623
03:04:17.548 --> 03:04:19.288
Go. Frodo!

1624
03:04:22.303 --> 03:04:23.793
Run.

1625
03:04:24.054 --> 03:04:25.715
Run!

1626
03:04:50.247 --> 03:04:51.908
Mr. Frodo!

1627
03:05:01.216 --> 03:05:02.956
Find the halfling!

1628
03:05:04.595 --> 03:05:07.132
Find the halfling!

1629
03:05:10.601 --> 03:05:12.262
Flendill

1630
03:05:18.776 --> 03:05:20.357
Aragorn. go!

1631
03:05:42.049 --> 03:05:43.380
Pippin: Frodo!

1632
03:05:43.967 --> 03:05:45.548
Hide here. Quick!

1633
03:05:46.178 --> 03:05:47.634
Come on!

1634
03:05:50.140 --> 03:05:52.131
What's he doing?

1635
03:05:56.397 --> 03:05:58.388
He's leaving.

1636
03:06:03.153 --> 03:06:06.065
- No!
- Pippin!

1637
03:06:10.994 --> 03:06:13.326
Merry: Run. Frodo. Go on!

1638
03:06:13.914 --> 03:06:16.997
- Hey! Hey. you!
- Over here!

1639
03:06:17.418 --> 03:06:18.999
- Over here!
- This way!

1640
03:06:29.847 --> 03:06:32.179
- It's working!
- I know it's working! Run!

1641
03:07:27.571 --> 03:07:30.608
- The horn of gondor.
- Boromir.

1642
03:08:13.700 --> 03:08:14.815
Run!

1643
03:11:46.413 --> 03:11:48.028
No

1644
03:11:51.877 --> 03:11:54.914
- They took the little ones.
- Hold still.

1645
03:11:55.255 --> 03:11:57.337
Frodo where is Frodo?

1646
03:12:01.344 --> 03:12:03.926
Then you did what I could not.

1647
03:12:04.931 --> 03:12:08.264
I tried to take the ring from him.

1648
03:12:08.769 --> 03:12:13.058
- The ring is beyond our reach now.
- Forgive me.

1649
03:12:13.273 --> 03:12:15.559
I did not see it.

1650
03:12:15.776 --> 03:12:18.939
- I have failed you all.
- No. Boromir.

1651
03:12:19.404 --> 03:12:21.941
You fought bravely.

1652
03:12:22.240 --> 03:12:24.902
You have kept your honor.

1653
03:12:25.452 --> 03:12:27.408
Boromir: I eave it.

1654
03:12:27.746 --> 03:12:29.782
It is over.

1655
03:12:30.957 --> 03:12:36.247
The world of men will fall.
And all will come to darkness

1656
03:12:36.671 --> 03:12:39.663
and my city to ruin.

1657
03:12:43.762 --> 03:12:46.469
I do not know what strength
is in my blood...

1658
03:12:46.640 --> 03:12:50.633
But I swear to you.
I will not let the white city fall...

1659
03:12:51.645 --> 03:12:54.136
Nor our people fail.

1660
03:12:55.148 --> 03:12:56.479
Our people.

1661
03:13:00.320 --> 03:13:02.436
Our people.

1662
03:13:24.177 --> 03:13:27.169
I would have followed you. my brother.

1663
03:13:28.723 --> 03:13:30.714
My captain.

1664
03:13:33.353 --> 03:13:35.309
My king.

1665
03:13:54.958 --> 03:13:57.199
Be at peace...

1666
03:13:57.544 --> 03:13:59.535
Son of gondor.

1667
03:14:16.062 --> 03:14:19.395
They will look for his coming
from the white tower.

1668
03:14:19.900 --> 03:14:22.892
But he will not return.

1669
03:14:46.092 --> 03:14:48.083
Frodo!

1670
03:15:07.572 --> 03:15:10.814
Frodo:
I wish the ring had never come to me.

1671
03:15:12.118 --> 03:15:15.110
I wish none of this had happened.

1672
03:15:18.083 --> 03:15:20.825
Gandalf: So do all who live
fo see such times.

1673
03:15:21.044 --> 03:15:24.457
But that is not for them to decide.

1674
03:15:24.631 --> 03:15:27.293
All you have to decide...

1675
03:15:27.550 --> 03:15:32.294
Is what to do with the time
that is given to you.

1676
03:16:01.126 --> 03:16:03.162
Frodo. no!

1677
03:16:03.670 --> 03:16:05.001
Frodo!

1678
03:16:05.839 --> 03:16:08.501
- Mr. Frodo!
- No. Sam.

1679
03:16:12.012 --> 03:16:14.003
Go back. Sam!

1680
03:16:14.514 --> 03:16:18.098
- I'm going to mordor alone.
- Of course you are.

1681
03:16:18.310 --> 03:16:21.143
And I'm coming with you!

1682
03:16:21.604 --> 03:16:24.016
You can't swim!

1683
03:16:27.819 --> 03:16:29.525
Sam!

1684
03:16:35.118 --> 03:16:36.403
Sam!

1685
03:17:17.369 --> 03:17:20.076
I made a promise. Mr. Frodo.

1686
03:17:20.413 --> 03:17:24.747
A promise:
"Don't you leave him. samwise gamgee."

1687
03:17:25.877 --> 03:17:28.459
And I don't mean to.

1688
03:17:28.755 --> 03:17:30.916
I don't mean to.

1689
03:17:32.592 --> 03:17:34.423
Sam.

1690
03:17:49.275 --> 03:17:50.936
Come on.

1691
03:18:19.431 --> 03:18:23.970
Hurry! Frodo and Sam
have reached the eastern shore.

1692
03:18:38.825 --> 03:18:43.819
- You mean not to follow them.
- Frodo's fate is no longer in our hands.

1693
03:18:47.292 --> 03:18:52.161
Then it has all been in vain.
The fellowship has failed.

1694
03:19:04.017 --> 03:19:07.180
Not if we hold true to each other.

1695
03:19:08.521 --> 03:19:13.015
We will not abandon merry and pippin
to torment and death

1696
03:19:14.027 --> 03:19:19.272
not while we have strength left.
Leave all that can be spared behind.

1697
03:19:20.533 --> 03:19:22.569
We travel light.

1698
03:19:22.785 --> 03:19:24.696
I et us hunt some orc.

1699
03:19:27.665 --> 03:19:29.701
Yes!

1700
03:19:48.686 --> 03:19:50.096
Frodo: Mordor.

1701
03:19:50.730 --> 03:19:54.097
I hope the others find a safer road.

1702
03:19:55.068 --> 03:19:57.605
Strider will look after them.

1703
03:19:58.571 --> 03:20:01.904
I don't suppose
we'll ever see them again.

1704
03:20:02.242 --> 03:20:04.699
We may yet. Mr. Frodo.

1705
03:20:04.911 --> 03:20:06.401
We may.

1706
03:20:08.540 --> 03:20:09.575
Sam.

1707
03:20:13.211 --> 03:20:15.827
I'm glad you are with me.
