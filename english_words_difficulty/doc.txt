to use difficulty service you should have two files, frequency.csv and stop_words.csv,
to generate these two files you should prepare a large file named by plain.txt in current directory,
that contains plain english text. then run frequency_calculator.py to generate csv files
and then frequency service is ready to use.

be careful that these lines should be called only for first time:
# nltk.download('stopwords')
# nltk.download('punkt')
